<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>BEA&#8217;S ROOMMATE</h3>
</div>

<p>Lila Allan went to college in the hope of
finding an intimate friend at last. Her
mother at home waited anxiously for her
earliest letters, and devoured them in eager
haste to discover some hint of success in the
search; for being a wise woman she knew her
own daughter, and understood the difficulty
as well as the necessity of the case.
</p>
<p>The first letter was written on the day of
arrival. It contained a frantic appeal for
enough money to buy her ticket home immediately,
because she had a lonesome room
away up in the north tower, and nobody had
spoken to her all the afternoon, and her trunk
had not come yet, and she did not know
where the dining-room was, and the corridors
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
were full of packing-boxes with lids scattered
around, and girls were hurrying to and fro
with step-ladders and kissing each other and
running to hug each other, and everything.
</p>
<p>The second letter, written the following
day, said that a freshman named Beatrice
Leigh had come up to help her unpack.
Beatrice had a long braid too, and her hair
was the loveliest auburn and curled around
her face, and she laughed a good deal. Lila
had noticed her the very first evening.
She was sitting at one of the tables in
the middle of the big dining-room. When
Lila saw her, she was giggling with her
head bent down and her napkin over her
eyes, while the other girls at that table smiled
amused smiles. Lila knew instantly that
this poor freshman had done something
dreadful, and she was sorry for her. Later
that same evening in Miss Merriam&#8217;s room she
told how she had marched in to dinner alone
and plumped down at that table among all
those seniors. She seemed to consider it a
joke, but Lila was sure she had been almost
mortified to death when she learned of her
mistake, and that was why she had laughed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
so hard. Several other freshmen were at Miss
Merriam&#8217;s. Two of them were named Roberta,
and one was named Gertrude something. But
Lila liked Beatrice best. Miss Merriam called
her Bea. Miss Merriam was a junior who had
invited in all the students at that end of the
corridor to drink chocolate. Lila did not care
for her much, because she had a loud voice
and tipped back in her chair and said yep for
yes.
</p>
<p>The third missive was only a postal card bearing
a properly telegraphic communication to
the effect that it was Saturday morning, and
Bea was waiting to escort her to the chapel to
hear read the lists of freshman names assigned
to each recitation section. Mrs. Allan scanned
the message with a quick throb of pleasure;
then sighed as she laid it down. The indications
were hopeful enough if only Lila would
be careful not to drive away this friend as she
had the others.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile on that Saturday morning Bea
and Lila, silent and shy, had crowded with
their two hundred classmates into chapel.
The two friends sat side by side. Lila was in
terror of making some horrible blunder that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
might overwhelm her with a vast indefinite
disgrace. She leaned forward in the pew, the
pencil trembling between her fingers, the
blood pounding in her ears, while from the
platform in front a cool voice read on evenly
through page after page of names. And then
at last the tragic despair of finding that she
had jotted down herself for two sections in
English and none in Latin! When she managed
to gasp out the awful situation in Bea&#8217;s
ear, that young person looked worried for full
half a minute. It was a very serious thing to
be a freshman. Then her cheery common
sense came to the rescue.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind. We&#8217;ll go up and look the
lists over after she has finished them all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, can we? Will you truly go with
me?&#8221; Lila drew a quick breath of relief and
gratitude. This was one of the precious
privileges of having found a friend. She
gazed at Bea with such an adorable half-wistful,
half-joyful smile on her delicate face that
Bea never quite forgot the sensation of realizing
that it was meant wholly for her. The
memory of it returned again and again in
later days when Lila&#8217;s exacting ways seemed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
beyond endurance. For Lila&#8217;s nature was one
of those that give all and demand all and
suffer in a myriad mysterious ways.
</p>
<p>On the afternoon of that Saturday when
Bea skipped up the narrow tower stairs to invite
Lila to go to the orchard to gather a
scrapbasket full of apples, she discovered the
door locked. In answer to her lively rat-tattoo
and gay call over the transom, she heard
the key turn.
</p>
<p>Bea started to dash in; then after one
glance stopped and fumbled uneasily with the
knob. In her happy-go-lucky childhood with
many brothers and sisters at home, tears had
always an embarrassing effect.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s&mdash;let&#8217;s go to the orchard,&#8221; she stammered.
&#8220;It&#8217;s lovely, and the fresh air will
help your&mdash;your headache.&#8221; She had a boyish
notion that anybody would prefer to excuse
heavy eyes by calling it headache rather
than tears.
</p>
<p>Lila pointed to the bed which was half
made up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you tell me?&#8221; she demanded
in agonized reproach. &#8220;I thought the maids
attended to the beds here. I left the mattress
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
turned over the foot all day long, and the
door was wide open. Everybody in the
neighborhood must have looked in and then
decided that I was lazy and shiftless. They
believe that I have been brought up to let
things go undone like that. They do, they
do! Miss Merriam just the same as said so.
She poked in her head a minute ago and said,
&#8216;Heigho, little one, time to make up your
bed. It has aired long enough and the maid
is not expected to do it.&#8217; She said that to
me! Oh, I hate her!&#8221; Lila caught her
breath hard.
</p>
<p>Bea opened her candid eyes wider in astonished
curiosity. &#8220;But didn&#8217;t you want
to know about the maid?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She mortified me. Do you know how it
feels to be mortified? The&mdash;the awfulness&mdash;&#8221; Lila
stopped and swallowed once or twice as
if something stuck in her throat. &#8220;She
might have told me in a different manner so
as not to wound me so heartlessly. She
isn&#8217;t a lady.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Please.&#8221; Bea twirled the door-knob in
worried protest. &#8220;Don&#8217;t talk that way. She
is my friend. We live in the same town.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
She&#8217;s nice, really. You&#8217;ve only seen the outside.
Please!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well!&#8221; Lila raised her shoulders
slightly. &#8220;She isn&#8217;t worth noticing, I dare
say. Such people never are. I can&#8217;t help
wishing that you were not acquainted with
her. I want you all to myself. I&#8217;m glad she
belongs to another class anyhow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Into Bea&#8217;s puzzled face crept a troubled
expression. &#8220;You&#8217;re a funny girl, Lila,&#8221; she
said; &#8220;let&#8217;s go to the orchard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>On their way across the campus, they
passed countless girls hurrying from building
to building. Every doorway seemed to
blossom with a chattering group, a loitering
pair, or an energetic single lady on pressing
business bent. Bea met every glance with a
look of bright friendliness in her eager eyes
and lips ready to smile, no matter whether
she had ever been introduced or not. But
Lila&#8217;s wild-flower face, in spite of its lovely
tints and outlines, seemed almost icy in its
expression of haughty criticism. No wonder,
then, that this miniature world of college reflected
a different countenance to each.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t they the dearest, sweetest girls you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
ever saw!&#8221; exclaimed Bea as the two freshmen
turned from the curving concrete walk
into the road that led to the orchard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw only one who was truly beautiful,&#8221;
commented her companion. &#8220;I expected to
find them prettier.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but they are so interesting,&#8221; protested
Bea in quick loyalty. &#8220;Nearly everybody
appears prettier after you get acquainted.
I&#8217;ve noticed that myself. It is better to dawn
than to dazzle, don&#8217;t you think? Sue Merriam,
for instance, improves and grows nicer
and nicer after you know her. You will
learn to love her dearly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never!&#8221;
</p>
<p>At the tone Bea gave an involuntary whistle;
then checked herself at sight of Lila&#8217;s quivering
lips. &#8220;Oh, well, don&#8217;t bother. Let&#8217;s go
on to the orchard. Look! There comes
Roberta Abbott with about a bushel of russets.
She is a funny girl too. To judge from her
appearance, you would say she was sad and
dignified. She has the most tragic dark eyes
and mouth. But just wait till you hear her
talk. Didn&#8217;t you meet her last night at
Sue&#8217;s?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; Lila turned away to hide the flicker
of jealousy, for she had learned long since
how transparently every emotion showed in
her features. &#8220;I think we ought not to waste
any time now. And anyway I&#8217;d rather get
acquainted with you all alone this afternoon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bea stared. &#8220;You&#8217;re the funniest girl!&#8221;
She walked on after waving a sociable hand
at Roberta. &#8220;It is interesting to have friends
that are different, don&#8217;t you think?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To have one friend who is different,&#8221;
corrected Lila.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; laughed Bea. &#8220;Oh, see what
a gorgeous glorious place this is, with the trees
and scarlet woodbine and the lake sparkling
away over there, and girls, girls, girls! But
I don&#8217;t believe that there is a single other one
exactly like you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>During the next week this thought recurred
to her more than once. By means of some
diplomatic maneuvering, the two friends
managed to have their single rooms exchanged
for a double. After moving in, Lila seized a
moment of solitude to plan a beautiful cozy
corner for Bea. She dragged her own desk
into a dusky recess and set Bea&#8217;s at an artistic
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
angle at the left side of the sunniest window.
Just as she was hanging her favorite picture
above it, Bea came rushing in with her arms
full of new books.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, no, no!&#8221; she exclaimed impulsively,
&#8220;that won&#8217;t do at all. You must
put it at the right so that the light will fall
over the left shoulder. Otherwise the shadow
of your hand will go scrambling over the
paper ahead of your pen. Here, let me show
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>By the time she had hauled the desk across
to its new position, Lila had vanished. Bea
found her huddled in a woe-begone heap behind
the wardrobe door in her bedroom, and
flew to her in dismay.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Lila, dearie, did you smash your finger
or drop something on your foot? There,
don&#8217;t cry. I&#8217;ll get the witch-hazel and arnica
and court-plaster. What is it? Where?
Why-ee!&#8221; she gasped bewildered, &#8220;why, Lila!&#8221;
for her weeping roommate had pushed her
gently away and turned her face to the wall.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was doing it for you,&#8221; she sobbed. &#8220;I
was trying to please you, and then you were
so cr-cr-cruel! You were cruel.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Cruel?&#8221; echoed Bea, &#8220;why, how? I
haven&#8217;t done a thing except buy the books I
ordered last week. Yours were down in the
office, too, but I didn&#8217;t have enough money
for all, because Sue Merriam borrowed four
dollars. She asked after you and said&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
Bea hesitated, smitten with novel doubt that
she ought to begin to think three times before
speaking once where such a sensitive person
was concerned.
</p>
<p>Lila sat up in swift attention and winked
away her tears. &#8220;Said what?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing much.&#8221; Bea wriggled.
&#8220;Just talking.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I insist.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, it doesn&#8217;t signify. I was only
thinking&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Bea paused again before
blurting out. &#8220;She said that roommates are
good for the character.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At this Lila rose with such an air of patient
endurance that poor Bea felt clumsy, remorseful,
injured and perplexed simultaneously. A
cloud of resentful silence hovered over them
both through the weary hours of the afternoon.
Not until the ten o&#8217;clock gong sent the echoes
booming through the deserted corridors, did
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
Lila break down in a storm of weeping that
terrified Bea. She found herself begging
pardon, apologizing, caressing, explaining and
repenting wholesale of rudeness about the
desk, of selfish neglect in the case of the books,
of disloyalty in giving ear to Miss Merriam&#8217;s
gratuitous comments. This gale blew over,
leaving one girl with darker circles under her
eyes and a more pathetic droop at the corners
of her mouth, leaving the other with a fellow
feeling for any unfortunate bull who happens
to get into a china shop, intentionally or
otherwise. Life at college promised to be like
walking over exceedingly thin ice every day
and all day long.
</p>
<p>And yet, after she had learned to make
allowances for the oversensitiveness, Bea found
Lila more lovable and winning week by week.
She was philosopher enough to recognize the
fact that every one has the &#8220;defects of his
qualities.&#8221; The very quality that sent Lila
hurrying up-stairs in an agony of mortification
because a senior had forgotten to bow to
her, was the one that inclined her to enter
into Bea&#8217;s varying moods with exquisite
responsiveness. It was delightful to have a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
friend who was ever ready to answer gayety
with gayety and sober thoughts with sympathy.
Indeed, when Lila was not wrapped
up in her own suffering, she could not be
surpassed in the priceless gift of sympathy.
For the sake of that, much might be forgiven.
</p>
<p>Much but not everything. Just before the
midyear examinations came a crisis in the
growth of their friendship. One afternoon
Lila reached the head of the stairs barely in
time to make a sudden swerve out of Miss
Merriam&#8217;s breezy path.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Heigho, Eliza Allan,&#8221; she called in careless
teasing, &#8220;why don&#8217;t you spell your name
the way it is in the catalogue? More dignified,
I think. By the way, I&#8217;ve been into your
room and left some burned cork for your chapter
play. We had more than we needed last
night. By-bye.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lila walked on in frosty silence. By-bye,
indeed! And to address her as Eliza, too, on
this very afternoon when she had as much as
she could bear anyhow. To hear her essay
read aloud and criticised before the class, and
then to have it handed to her across the desk,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
so that anybody could see the awful <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Rewrite</span>
in red ink scrawled on the outside! To be
sure, all the essays had been distributed at the
same time, and nobody knew for sure that
hers had been the one read aloud. Still they
might have seen the name on it or noticed
how red and pale she turned, or something.
And worse still, the examinations were coming
soon, and she was sure she would fail. If
it were not for leaving Bea, she would go home
that night. She certainly would!
</p>
<p>As she entered, Bea looked up brightly
from the cardboard which she was cutting
into squares.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here you are!&#8221; she exclaimed in cheery
greeting, though her eyes had shadowed instantly
at sight of the unhappy drooping of
every line. &#8220;Sue Merriam has been in to
show me how to make you up for the play
next month. It takes quite an artistic touch
to darken the brows and touch up the lashes.
Catch these corks and put them away.
They&#8217;re messing up my dinner-cards.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lila&#8217;s shoulders quivered as if pricked by a
spur even while she mechanically caught the
bits of black and fumbled them in her fingers.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span></p>
<p>&#8220;She meant that my brows are too thin
and my lashes too light. I would thank her
to keep her criticism until it is called for.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For half a minute Bea kept her head down
while her chest heaved over a sigh of weary
anticipation. Then she turned with an affectionate
query: &#8220;What has happened now,
Lila? Tell me, dear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Upon hearing about the affair of the essay,
she expostulated consolingly, &#8220;Of course that
is no disgrace. She is severe with all the
girls, tears their essays into strips and empties
the red ink over them. She doesn&#8217;t mean it
personally, you know. How can we learn anything
if nobody corrects our mistakes? Anyway
it was an honor to have it read aloud.
Very likely the girls did not see the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Rewrite</span>.
She never bothers much with the utterly
hopeless papers. Come, cheer up! The red
ink was a compliment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you really think so?&#8221; Lila smiled a
little doubtfully. &#8220;It sounds like one of the
sophists&mdash;&#8216;to make the worse appear the better
reason.&#8217; I&#8217;d love to believe it, and you
are sweet to me.&#8221; She laid one arm caressingly
across Bea&#8217;s shoulders. &#8220;It is queer
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
that I don&#8217;t mind more when you scold me so
outrageously.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Scold you?&#8221; repeated the other in amazement
at such a description of her soothing
speech.
</p>
<p>Lila nodded. &#8220;I never stood it from anybody
else. Maybe it is because you are my
special dearest friend. That is why I came to
college, you know. At home the girls disappointed
me. There were several in the high
school who might have been my friends if
they had been different from what they were.
Ena Brownell and I were inseparable for
weeks till one morning she went off with another
girl instead of waiting for me on the
corner, though I had telephoned that I would
meet her there. Even if I was a few minutes
late, she would have waited if she had really
cared. I cried myself to sleep every night for
a long time but I never forgave her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Um-m-m,&#8221; muttered Bea, her head
again bent over the cardboard, &#8220;how horrid!
See, isn&#8217;t this a lovely daisy I&#8217;m drawing?
They&#8217;re to be dinner cards for my next spread.
This is for your place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s sweet. I think you are the most
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
talented girl in the class.&#8221; Lila stooped for a
hug but carefully so as not to interfere with
the growth of the silvery petals. &#8220;There was
another girl, and her name was Daisy. She
seemed perfect till I discovered that she
prized her own vanity more highly than my
happiness. She refused to take gym work
the third hour when I was obliged to have it.
She said the shower bath spoiled the wave in
her hair, and so she chose the sixth hour class.
Yet she knew very well that I had Latin at
that period. I don&#8217;t care for that selfish kind
of friendship, do you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Um-m, no!&#8221; Bea&#8217;s brush dropped an
impatient splash of yellow in the heart of the
flower. Then she glanced up with a penitent
smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re so awfully loyal yourself, Lila,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;You try to measure everybody up
to that standard. I shan&#8217;t forget that day in
hygiene when you declined to answer the
question that floored me. It was like that
poem about the girl who wouldn&#8217;t spell a
word that the boy had missed, because she
hated to go above him. And at the tennis
tournament you wouldn&#8217;t leave till I had finished
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
the match, though you shivered and
shook in the frosty October air. You do a lot
for me, and I am downright ashamed sometimes.
See, behold the completed posy!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is too pretty for a mere dinner card.&#8221;
Lila dropped into a rattan chair and idly
tossed the corks from hand to hand. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t
you planning a long time ahead? Your family
knows exactly what to send in a box.
That last was the most delicious thing! I suppose
we&#8217;ll just ask our crowd of freshmen,
Berta and Gertrude and the rest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lila&#8217;s eyes were so intent upon the dancing
corks that she failed to note the swift glance
which Bea darted in her direction.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Um-m-m,&#8221; she said cautiously, &#8220;I think
I might like an upper class girl or two.
Some of them have been awfully kind to me
this year. Sue Merriam escorted me to the
first Hall Play, and she proposed our names
for Alpha, and on her birthday she asked me
to sit at her table and meet some seniors as an
invited guest. She said the &#8220;invited&#8221; with
such a thump on it that my heart almost
broke. Isn&#8217;t she the greatest tease?&#8221;
</p>
<p>No answer.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It was mostly due to her that I came to
college,&#8221; continued Bea with an effort to speak
naturally though her fingers shook the least
bit in their grasp of the brush, and one anxious
eye was watching Lila&#8217;s face. &#8220;I&#8217;ve known
her all my life. She persuaded the family to
send me, and she tutored me last summer and
helped in a million different ways. You don&#8217;t
understand how much I owe her. It is such
a little thing to invite her to my&mdash;to our
party. I&#8217;d love to do it, Lila.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Still no answer. The silence lengthened
out minute after minute. Finally Bea ventured
to raise her head and hold up another
card for inspection. &#8220;See, a new daisy, but
this one has a different disposition. Do you
observe the expression&mdash;sort of grinning and
cheerful? This is like Sue, while the first
one is like you, an earnest young person, not
one bit impudent. See it, lady. The dearest
flower-face. I love it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet&#8221;&mdash;Lila&#8217;s voice sounded choked,
&#8220;you want to invite her to the party. You
know it will spoil my pleasure. You&mdash;know&mdash;I&mdash;hate&mdash;her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bea&#8217;s frame trembled once in a nervous
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
shiver. Her fascinated eyes followed Lila to
the window, where she stood staring out at
the dazzling winter world of snow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must choose between Susan Merriam
and me. I have a right to demand it. I
have a right. I have a right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bea saw Lila lift her arm as if to brush
away the tears. Then one hand fumbled for
her handkerchief, while the other squeezed
the burned corks with unconscious force. She
was certainly wiping her eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must&mdash;you must&mdash;choose to-day&mdash;between
Susan Merriam and me. If you
choose her, I shall never speak to you again.
If you choose me, you must have nothing to
do with her. Nothing! You must drop her
acquaintance. You cannot have both.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bea suddenly tipped back in her chair,
teetered to and fro for a frantic moment, then
brought it down with a bump on all four feet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; she snapped.
</p>
<p>Lila stood motionless so long that Bea had
time to notice the ticking of her watch. Then
she turned slowly around from the window.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And this is friendsh&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>

LILA STOOD STARING OUT AT THE SNOW
<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; squealed Bea, &#8220;oh, oh, oh! Ha,
ha, ha!&#8221; Flinging her arms out over the
desk she buried her face upon them and
shook with uncontrollable laughter.
</p>
<p>Lila crimsoned to her hair, then went white
with anger. Without a word she walked into
her own room and locked the door.
</p>
<p>Half an hour later when she rose from
the bed and began to pour out a basinful of
water to bathe her smarting eyes, she heard a
rustle on the threshold. Glancing quickly
around she saw a square of white paper being
thrust beneath the door. It was a letter from
home on the five o&#8217;clock mail. Lila picked it
up and opened it listlessly. The fit of weeping
had left her exhausted.
</p>
<p style='line-height: 1'>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&#8220;My darling daughter,&#8221; she read,
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a hasty note to say that your great
aunt Sarah is on her way east, and will stop
at the college for a day&#8217;s visit with you. I
wish to caution you, dear girl, against even
the semblance of a slight in your treatment
of her. Do not forget to inquire after Gyp
the terrier, Rex the angora cat, Dandy the
parrot, and Ellen the maid. Your aunt is
exceedingly sensitive about such small attentions.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
You might invite your friends to
meet her at afternoon tea, and if you can
manage it tactfully you might warn them not
to discuss topics with which she is unacquainted.
She has, as you know, a very
peculiar disposition. The least suspicion of
neglect or hint of criticism exasperates her
beyond endurance. In her childhood she
suffered continually because of this oversensitive
nature. I suspect that she made no
effort to conquer the fault. Indeed so far as
I may judge from her present attitude, she
has always considered it a proof of superior
delicacy and refinement. She has cherished
her selfishness instead of fighting it. As a
consequence her life has been embittered and
unspeakably lonely. I believe that she has
not a friend on earth except her pets, and
even Gyp has learned not to frisk with joy at
sight of anybody but his mistress.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure I may trust you, dear, to make
her visit as happy as possible, although in
truth it seems irony to speak of real happiness
in connection with such a temperament.
You may not be aware that even your Aunt
Sarah was once the heroine of a romance.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
He was an extraordinarily fine man, and she
would have found happiness with him, if with
anybody. But one day in the rush of an important
law-suit, he forgot to keep an engagement
with her, and she never forgave the
slight. After that disappointment&mdash;and it
was a grievous disappointment, however self-inflicted&mdash;especially
grievous to such an expert
in self-torture&mdash;her nature grew rapidly
and steadily more self-absorbed and unlovely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My darling little daughter, sometimes I
have feared that you may have inherited a
similar tendency. It has been difficult,
dearest, to guide aright where even the
slightest word of criticism stings and burns
and lashes. You, more than many girls, need
the discipline of wisest, frankest friendship
with others of your own age. I see that during
your high school days I did wrong in trying
to supply their place to you with my own
companionship. A child, however precious,
cannot be forever kept wrapped in cotton-wool.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So, dearest daughter, you will understand
how joyful I am this year in hearing of your
new friends. Don&#8217;t let them slip away
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
through any fault of yours. Whatever is
worth winning is worth keeping, even at the
cost of many a sacrifice of foolish pride.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When you see your aunt, be sure to remember
me to her.

<p>Lila read the letter, replaced it in the envelope,
and walking across the little room
threw herself again face downward on the
bed. After a while the dressing-gong whirred
its tidings through the corridors. Lila slid
to her feet and began to walk mechanically
toward the mirror.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But Bea laughed. She laughed at me.
Mother doesn&#8217;t know that Bea laughed. And
I thought she was my friend.&#8221; Lila felt
another sob come tearing up toward her
throat and clenched her teeth in the struggle
to choke it back. Blinded by a rush of
fresh tears, she opened the top drawer of the
bureau and felt for her brush with groping
fingers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She laughed right in my face. I&mdash;I&mdash;could
have forgiven everything else. But&mdash;but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
mother doesn&#8217;t know that Bea in-insulted
me. She&mdash;laughed&mdash;right&mdash;in&mdash;my&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then through the blur Lila happened to
catch sight of her reflection in the looking-glass.
The last sob broke off sheer in the
middle, and left her with her lips still parted
in an unfinished quiver.
</p>
<p>The horrified face that stared back at her
from the mirror was striped and rayed with
startling streaks of black. The astonished
eyes shone out from white circles framed in
ebony sunbursts; the nose was like an islet
washed by jetty waves; the mouth slowly
widened under a fiercely upcurved line of
inky hue.
</p>
<p>In the study on the other side of the door,
remorseful Bea was wearing several paths in
their best rug, as she waited for some sign.
Suddenly a new sound welled up and she
bent her head to listen, in quick dread of
another storm of weeping. But, no! This
was different. It was not a sob, though it
did seem rather gaspy. It bubbled and chuckled.
It was laughter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lila!&#8221; cried Bea, and made a dash
toward the room. Lila flung open the door.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Bea!&#8221; she answered, &#8220;I am going to
give a tea for my Aunt Sarah. Do you
think Sue Merriam will come if I invite
her?&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>ENTER ROBBIE BELLE</h3>
</div>

<p>Now it happened one evening in the early
fall, while Bea and Lila were learning to live
together, that the Students&#8217; Association held
a meeting to appoint corridor wardens for the
year.
</p>
<p>In the throng that came pouring out of
chapel afterward, Bea, who had an eel-like
rapidity in gliding through crowds, found
herself at the doors some yards in advance of
Lila. Halting to wait in the vestibule, she
overheard a junior instructing a new freshman
officer in her duties.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very simple. Oh, no, Miss Sanders,
no, indeed! There is nothing meddlesome
about it. You&#8217;re not expected to spy upon
the girls in your neighborhood. The aim is
merely to preserve a certain degree of quiet.
Girls are often thoughtless about being noisy
in the corridors. Simply remind them now
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
and then in flagrant cases that they are disturbing
those who wish to study. Of course
you must be tactful, though it is rarely that
a student wilfully disregards the rights of
others.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bea peered around the edge of her particular
door in order to catch a glimpse of
this freshman so distinguished. It was the
tall, fair-faced child with the splendid long
braid, who lived at the end of Berta&#8217;s transverse.
Now the sweet mouth was drooping
disconsolately, and the big eyes looked dewy
with anxious tears.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d like to,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but it is something that must be
done, and you have been selected as the one
in that vicinity who strikes us as best fitted
for the duties of the position. It is really,
you know, a case of public service. Every
one at some time or other ought to be willing
to make sacrifices of personal desires for the
good of the community, don&#8217;t you think?
But forgive me for preaching. I didn&#8217;t mean
to. By the way, how do you like college,
Miss Sanders?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t so much fun as I had expected,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
said she. Bea&#8217;s head popped around the door
again. The junior was smiling with an air of
amused superiority.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, I understand. Probably you
used to have a sister or cousin at college, and
from her letters you supposed that the life
was composed chiefly of dancing, fudges and
basket-ball with a little work sandwiched in
between. Is it not so? And now&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind the work,&#8221; here Bea&#8217;s head
popped out a third time to contemplate this
interesting classmate, &#8220;but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Beatrice,&#8221; called Lila at her other ear,
&#8220;Berta says to hurry or we&#8217;ll miss the best of
the fun. It&#8217;s to be a sheet-and-pillow-case
party to-morrow, and a lot of the girls are
coming in to learn how to do the draping.
Berta has an idea. Come along quick!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Robbie Belle Sanders stared after them
wistfully. &#8220;Those girls live near me,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;they have fun all the time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The junior&#8217;s keen glance spied in the open
countenance something that kept her lingering
a moment longer. &#8220;This is a democratic
place,&#8221; she said in a more sympathetic tone,
&#8220;every girl finds her own level sooner or later.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
The basis is not money or social rank of the
families at home. It is not brains or clothes
or stuff like that. It is simply that the same
kind of girls drift together. They&#8217;re congenial.
It seems to be a law. A general law, you
understand. Of course,&#8221; she hesitated for an
instant before being spurred on by her sense
of scrupulous honesty, &#8220;there are exceptions.
Once in a while a girl fails to find her
special niche. Maybe she rooms off the
campus and is not thrown in contact with her
own kind. She may be abnormally shy&mdash;that
hinders her from making friends. Or perhaps
she does something that queers herself
first thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Queers herself?&#8221; echoed Robbie Belle,
&#8220;how does a person queer herself?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; She paused to reflect.
&#8220;She does outlandish things. And still it
isn&#8217;t what she does so much as what she is.
Her acts express her character. If her character
is queer, she behaves queerly, and the
others fight shy of her. After all, I dare say
she does find her own level, and there is nobody
else there. So she goes along solitary
through the four years.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></p>
<p>Robbie Belle looked frightened. &#8220;I wish I
knew what things are queer,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, being different from the other girls,
for instance, awfully different, so different
that everybody notices it. Not just original,
you know, but actually queer. Watch the
girls, particularly those who always go around
alone, and you&#8217;ll learn. Good-night, Miss
Sanders. I must congratulate you again on
the honor of being appointed freshman warden.
Good-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Robbie Belle walked slowly down the corridor
to her room. &#8220;I wonder if I am queer,&#8221;
she thought. &#8220;I am almost always alone.&#8221;
She halted before a door that displayed a
small square of white paper pinned in the
middle of its upper half. Robbie Belle, her
hand on the knob, regarded the sign hopelessly.
&#8220;If you have a roommate who never
takes down her <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Engaged</span>, and she doesn&#8217;t like
company and she won&#8217;t go anywhere with
you herself, maybe you can&#8217;t help being
queer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Robbie Belle entered softly. It was a large
room and seemed quite bare because of the
absence of curtains, rugs, and cushions. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
unsociable roommate was sitting beside the
centre table, her elbows propped on its shiny
surface that was innocent of any cover and
ignorant of the duster. A green shade over
her eyes connected a blur of nondescript hair
with a rather long nose beneath which a pair
of pale lips in the glow of the drop-light
was rapidly gabbling over some lines in Greek
scansion.
</p>
<p>Without looking up, she waved one hand
forbiddingly; and Robbie Belle obediently
shut her mouth over the few words that were
ready to be uttered in greeting. She stood
waiting in her tracks, so to speak, until the
final hexameter had wailed out its drawling
length, and Miss Cutter pushed back the green
shade.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she demanded, &#8220;what was the important
business before the meeting? I could
not spare valuable time for self-government
foolishness to-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They appointed corridor wardens,&#8221; answered
Robbie Belle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, indeed! It is certainly time, I must
say. In theory it is all very well to make the
rules a matter of honor, but when you happen
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
to live in a nest of girls who behave as if they
were six years old, I insist that something
more forcible than chapel admonitions is required.
Who is the warden for this neighborhood?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; said Robbie Belle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are!&#8221; Miss Cutter pushed the green
shade farther up on her high forehead. &#8220;Well,
I must say!&#8221; She surveyed her roommate
with new interest. &#8220;How exceedingly extraordinary!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Robbie shifted her weight to the other foot.
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to be,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, of course not, and you nothing but a
child yourself. It must be your height and
that grave way you have of staring. With
that baby-face, couldn&#8217;t they see that your
dignity is all on the outside?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Robbie said nothing, but if Miss Cutter had
not been quite so near-sighted she might have
spied deep in the violet eyes a glint of black
remotely resembling anger.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Think of appealing to a sixteen-year-old
infant&mdash;really you are literally in-fans, which
is to say, one without the power of speech!
Fancy me applying to you to compel quiet
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
in the halls! Imagine that boisterous crowd
trailing after Miss Abbott and Miss Leigh et al.&mdash;Hist!&#8221;
She lifted her head like a warhorse
sniffing battle near. &#8220;There they are now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Robbie Belle lifted her head too and
listened, although indeed the noise would
have penetrated to the most inattentive ears.
A multitude of feet were marching lock-step
past the door to a chorus of giggling, stifled
squeals and groans, while at intervals a voice
choking with emotion rose in shrill accents:
&#8220;There was an old woman all skin and bones,
o-o-oh!&#8221; When it faltered and collapsed on
the o-o-oh, the other voices joined in and
dragged out the syllable to lugubrious and
harrowing length. Then some one giggled
hysterically and another squealed. The soloist
took up the verse: &#8220;She went to the
church to pray, o-o-oh!&#8221; The chorus wailed
and moaned and croaked and whimpered and
groaned in concert. Miss Cutter regarded
Robbie Belle sternly.
</p>
<p>Robbie Belle&#8217;s shoulders rose and fell over
a deep breath. She stepped across to the door
and closed the transom softly just as the next
weird line hissed out above the tumult and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
then sank into its smothering welter and moan
of vowels. Robbie spoke more loudly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One of them said that they were going to
dress up in sheets and pillow-cases to-night.
They are practicing for the Hallowe&#8217;en party.
It&#8217;s only fun.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Berta&#8217;s voice&mdash;it was Berta who did the solo&mdash;here
rose in a quavering shriek that halted
not for keys in their holes or transoms in their
sockets: &#8220;The worms crawled in and the
worms crawled out, o-o-o-oh!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Cutter rose to her indignant feet.
&#8220;Roberta Sanders, as you are the corridor
warden for this neighborhood, I appeal to you.
I make formal complaint&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve gone.&#8221; Robbie Belle smiled in
relief and sat down rather quickly. The
lock-step had receded into the muffled distance
and the ear-splitting wail wafted back
in tones that grew steadily fainter.
</p>
<p>Miss Cutter took off her glasses, rubbed
them bright, put them on again, and contemplated
Robbie Belle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do believe that you would rather I suffered
than that they became offended with
you. You are afraid to rebuke them.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></p>
<p>Robbie&#8217;s eyes fell and the guilty color rose
slowly through the delicate skin of throat and
brow. But Miss Cutter did not see it. She
had pulled down the green shade and propping
her elbows in their former position had
returned to her scansion. She had wasted too
much time already.
</p>
<p>Conscience-smitten Robbie Belle slid silently
through the door and stood at loss for a
minute in the deserted corridor. It was Friday
night. Nobody studied on Friday night
except girls who were queer or who roomed
with superior special students like Miss Cutter.
On her first day at college Miss Cutter
had remarked that there might be a vacant
seat of congenial minds for Robbie at her table.
Somehow the grave young freshman who was
hoping for fun failed to find them satisfying.
She had not won a real friend yet, and here it
was the end of October.
</p>
<p>Robbie Belle was not conceited enough to
feel sorry for herself, or else she might have
perceived a certain pathos in that listless
journey of a lonely child from her worse than
solitary room to the deadly quiet of the
library. One of the hilarious ghosts who
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
were weaving spells under the evergreens happened
to glance in through a great softly shining
window and recognized the drooping head
above a long deserted table between the shelves
of books.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s our noble warden,&#8221; whispered Bea,
&#8220;studying on Friday night! Looks like a
dig as well as a prig, n&#8217;est-ce-pas?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Berta&#8217;s eager dark face grew sober under
the swathing folds of her pillow-case. &#8220;Maybe
it isn&#8217;t her fault,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>But Robbie Belle unaware of this precious
drop of sympathy plodded through an essay
on Intellect, wrote out a laborious analysis,
and at the stroke of the nine-thirty gong crept
reluctantly back to her room. The next
morning she translated her Latin, committed
a geometrical demonstration to a faithful
memory, consumed a silent luncheon amid a
dizzying cross-fire of psychological arguments,
walked around the garden, through the pines
and over the orchard hill for a scrupulously
full hour of exercise, read her physiology
notes, and composed one page of her weekly
theme before dinner time. After dinner she
stood in a corner of Parlor J and watched the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
dancing. Then she went to chapel with Miss
Cutter, returned alone in haste to dress in the
concealing sheet and pillow case. It was
rather difficult to manage the drapery without
aid, especially in the back and at the sides.
The strange junior who had chosen Robbie&#8217;s
name from the class list and undertaken to
escort her to the party found awaiting her a
rumpled young ghost with raiment that
sagged and bagged quite distressingly in unexpected
places. But the eyes that shone
from between the crooked bands of white were
joyous with excitement. In this disguise she
was sure that no one would recognize her;
and so of course they would not know that she
was queer, and perhaps she would have fun at
last.
</p>
<p>And at first it really seemed as if she would.
Imagine a big gymnasium with jack-o&#8217;-lanterns
on the rafters and a blazing wood-fire in the
wide fireplace, and five hundred figures in
white circling and mingling among the
shadows, and at least a thousand sticks of
candy, and three big dish-pans full of peanuts,
and gallons and gallons of red lemonade.
When her escort proposed that they should go
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
up-stairs to look in upon the seniors and
sophomores who were having a country dance,
Robbie Belle moistened her lips and said, &#8220;If
you please, don&#8217;t wait for me. I enjoy it so
much here.&#8221; Then at the junior&#8217;s formal,
&#8220;Oh, certainly, Miss Sanders!&#8221; she remembered
that often people did not understand
her unless she used a bothersome number of
words. So she added hastily, &#8220;I mean that
you must go with your own friends and leave
me here, because I am watching some girls I
know, and I want to speak to them. Please
don&#8217;t trouble any more about me, thank
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do know them,&#8221; she assured herself as
her escort disappeared, &#8220;and I do want to
speak to them even if they don&#8217;t know me. I
think&#8221;&mdash;she hesitated and turned quite pale
at the prospect of such daring, &#8220;I think I
shall go and play with them. They will
suppose I am one of them. Nobody will
know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At this point the file of impudent ghosts,
headed by Berta, who looked unusually tall
and still angular under her flowing sheet,
paraded past Robbie Belle&#8217;s corner, their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
elbows flapping like wings. With a gasp for
courage she took one step forward and found
herself prancing along at the end of the line.
</p>
<p>It was such fun! Robbie Belle had shot up
to an annoying stature so comparatively early
in life that her romping days seemed to have
broken short off in the middle. She had
never had enough of tag and hide-and-seek
and coasting. She hated long skirts. Indeed
that was one reason why she longed to join
the enviable circle of freshmen around Berta:
they wore golf skirts all day long, except
when hockey called for the gymnasium costume
or bicycling demanded its appropriate
array. The reason why she liked Miss Abbott
best of course was because her name was Roberta,
too.
</p>
<p>On this Hallowe&#8217;en, in joyous faith in her
disguise, she forgot her height and breadth
and the dignity imposed thereby. And anyhow
Berta Abbott was just as tall, if not of
such stately proportions. So Robbie Belle
with exulting zest in the frolic raced up-stairs
and down with the mischievous band of
freshmen. They skipped saucily around
members of the faculty, chased appreciative
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
juniors, frightened the smallest forms into
scuttling flight, and gave their great performance
of &#8220;There was an old woman all
skin and bones,&#8221; in the middle of the upper
hall, where the seniors were entertaining the
sophomores.
</p>
<p>It was fun to howl. It was so long since
Robbie Belle had grown up that she had
almost forgotten the joy of using her lungs to
their full capacity. With her spirits dancing
in the afterglow of such vocal exercise, she
marched after the others down to the hall
below. There in the vestibule Berta halted
her followers for final instructions.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, girls, fall into line according to
height. We are going to astonish&mdash;&mdash;Why!&#8221;
She fixed two amazed dark eyes
upon the tallest, &#8220;who are you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Robbie Belle heard; she felt her heart
shriveling within her; her shoulders seemed
to shrink together; her head drooped. Then
turning away slowly she moved toward the
gymnasium apartment, a loose corner of her
robe trailing at her abashed heels. But she did
not escape swiftly enough to avoid catching
the sound of hisses.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ha! an interloper!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hist! ye false intruder!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Seize him! To the shambles!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To the guillotine! Ho, brothers! pursue!&#8221;
</p>
<p>That made Robbie Belle flee so fast that
she was able to take refuge behind Prexie
himself while the vengeful furies withdrew to
a respectful distance. That night when she
was shaking her pillow back into its case
Robbie noticed some damp spots amid its
creases. A few minutes later she laid her
head down on it and proceeded to create some
more. There was only one comfort in the
throng of scorching reflections: this was that
it had not been Berta&#8217;s voice that had called
her an intruder. Perhaps Berta did not think
she had done something so awfully wicked
after all.
</p>
<p>This faint hope infused more dreadful bitterness
into the incident that happened in
mathematics C on Monday. Anybody would
have believed that Berta was offended past
forgiveness. She sat next to Robbie. She
was not very well prepared that morning,
possibly in consequence of Saturday&#8217;s excitement.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
The instructor was more than usually
curt and crisp with an unsmiling sternness
that struck terror to palpitating freshman
hearts. In the middle of the hour Berta became
aware that a problem was traveling rapidly
down the row toward her; and she had
not been paying attention. She had not even
noticed the statement of it, for it had started
at an apparently safe distance from her seat.
Turning with a swift motion of the lips she
asked Robbie Belle to tell her. And Robbie
Belle&mdash;how she longed to tell it! It had almost
leaped from her lips while conscience
reasoned wildly against it as deceit. It would
not be honest. And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;the girls
would think she was queer. They would say
she was mean and priggish, for she might
have told Berta as easily as not.
</p>
<p>There! the third girl from Berta was trying
to explain her own ignorance and failing
brilliantly. Now the second was stammering
through a transparent bluff. Berta had
settled back, coolly resigned to fate. How she
must suffer, after having stooped to ask for
aid! Poor Robbie Belle! Poor, lonely, disappointed
Robbie Belle! For strange to say she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
flunked too and the question journeyed on
triumphantly to the mathematical prodigy at
the end of the row.
</p>
<p>In the corridor outside Berta exerted her
nimble self to overtake Miss Sanders, who was
sidling away in a strikingly unprincesslike
manner, her eyes shifting guiltily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So you didn&#8217;t know the answer either?
Wasn&#8217;t that the biggest joke on me! And
really, Miss Sanders, I beg your pardon for
asking. It popped out before I could gather
my wits. I am scared to death in that class,
though of course that is no excuse for sponging.
I&#8217;m glad you didn&#8217;t know it enough to
tell me after all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Robbie Belle lifted the lashes from her
flushed cheeks. &#8220;I&mdash;I did know it,&#8221; she said
with a gulp.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said Berta, and stared, &#8220;how&mdash;how
peculiar!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Robbie Belle held back the tears till she
had reached her room, seized her hat and
snatched her thickest veil. Then she fled to
the loneliest walk among the pines. Her veil
was a rarity that rendered her an object of
curiosity to everybody she passed on the way.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
But she hurried on, somewhat comforted by
the conviction that no one could mark her
reddened eyelids. In truth she had good
need of comfort, for Berta Abbott herself had
said that she was peculiar. And peculiar
meant queer!
</p>
<p>That evening Robbie sat down to study for
the Latin test announced for the next day.
Miss Cutter was studying, too, harder than
ever. The green shade was pulled so fiercely
forward that a fringe of hair stood up in a
crown where the elastic had rumpled it. Her
grammar, lexicon and text-book occupied most
of the table, but Robbie did not complain.
She could manage very well by laying her
books, one on the open face of another, in
her lap. For once she was grateful that an
<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Engaged</span> sign shielded them from interruptions,
for Latin was her shakiest subject, especially
the rules of indirect discourse. The
instructor had warned the class that this weak
spot was to be the point of attack. If
Robbie Belle should not succeed in drumming
the rules into her head before the ideas in it
began to spin around and around in their
usual dizzy fashion when she waxed sleepy,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
she might just as well stay away from the
recitation room. Or better perhaps, for in
absence there was a possibility of both doubt
and hope: hope on Robbie Belle&#8217;s part that
she might have been able to answer the questions
if she had been there, on the teacher&#8217;s
part doubt concerning the exact extent of the
pupil&#8217;s knowledge.
</p>
<p>At the end of the corridor just outside
their door a narrow stairway led to the north
tower rooms on the floor above. Beatrice
Leigh and Lila Allan and a number of their
liveliest friends lived up there on the fifth,
with Berta Abbott at the foot of the stairs
near Robbie&#8217;s place of abode.
</p>
<p>Just as Robbie&#8217;s usually serene brow was
puckering its hardest over the sequence of
tenses, a door banged open in the tower and
the stairs creaked under swift clatter of
feet&mdash;a dozen at the very least.
</p>
<p>Miss Cutter scowled beneath the green
shade; Robbie Belle could tell that from the
way the fringe of upright hair vibrated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Savages!&#8221; she muttered, &#8220;they&#8217;ll tear the
building to pieces. No wonder the newspapers
report that the college girl&#8217;s favorite
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
mode of locomotion is sliding down the banisters.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Robbie Belle, &#8220;not that. They
take hold of the railing and jump several
steps at a time. I&#8217;ve seen them. Miss Leigh
says she does it for exercise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And this also is exercise!&#8221; Miss Cutter
clutched her ears as a tornado swept past their
threshold.
</p>
<p>Robbie bent to listen anxiously. &#8220;They&#8217;re
going to the ice-cooler,&#8221; she said, &#8220;pretty soon
they will go back again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Miss Cutter as she rose and
moved toward the door, &#8220;they will doubtless
go back, and doubtless also they shall go in a
different manner.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then she went out and remonstrated briefly
but to the point. Whereupon the culprits
apologized with noble profusion and tiptoed
their way to the stairs. This would have
been an admirable proof of repentance if their
heels had not persisted in coming down on
the bare boards in very loud clicks at very
short intervals. And every click was greeted
by a reproving chorus of &#8220;Sh-sh-sh!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The instant they reached the hall above,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
pandemonium broke loose. To judge from
the sounds, they were playing blindman&#8217;s
buff with scampering of heavy shoes, scraping
of chairs, banging against walls, flopping on
mattresses. Even reluctant Robbie Belle
looked upward in fear that the ceiling might
fall. When a deputation of wild eyed sophomores
from an adjacent study arrived to protest
against a continuation of the outrage, the
shrinking corridor-warden had no loophole
for escape from her duty. Outwardly calm,
inwardly quivering, she mounted the stairs to
expostulate on behalf of the Students&#8217; Association
for Self-Government.
</p>
<p>When the peace officer reached the foot of
the flight, the noise sank abruptly into a silent
scurrying&mdash;on unadulterated tiptoes this time.
When she appeared at the top, she beheld the
tower hall deserted, every door shut and a
suspiciously profound stillness reigning in the
dimly lighted Paradise of fun. Ah! she drew
a breath of relief from away down in her
boots. Surely now she had performed her
duty. Nobody could expect her to find fault
after the disturbance had ceased. Now the girls
below would be at liberty to study in peace.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></p>
<p>Barely had she completed her hurried descent
before the strange silence above was
shattered suddenly by the simultaneous banging
of seven doors. Seven full-lunged voices
burst forth into a howling song, while twice
as many feet thumped and tapped and pranced
and pounded in the mazes of an extemporaneous
jig.
</p>
<p>Robbie Belle halted instantly, with a quick
lift of her head. Her nostrils quivered. Her
violet eyes snapped black. Her hands
clenched. Turning swiftly she mounted the
stairs once more. But this time she was
angry. The uproar was an insult to the authority
of the Students&#8217; Association. She forgot
for the minute all about shy Robbie Belle.
</p>
<p>And the mischievous freshmen above&mdash;the
flippant fun-loving irresponsible six-year-old
freshmen&mdash;they waited ready to meet the
warden with an impudent burst of revelry,
and thus to dash her official dignity from its
exasperating estate. When they saw Robbie
Belle&#8217;s face they simply stared. They listened
in silence to the few rapid words that stung
and burned and smarted. They watched her
depart, her head still held at its angle of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
wrathful justice. Then they looked at one
another.
</p>
<p>They could not see how, when once safely
in the haven of her room, she broke down utterly
and lay trembling and sobbing in Miss
Cutter&#8217;s astonished arms. Now at last she
had surely committed an unpardonable offense
against the only girls for whom she
cared in the whole collegeful&mdash;especially
Berta. Now Berta would be certain she was
queer.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile in the tower, Berta drew a long
breath and glanced around at her dismayed
and sobered companions.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The more I see of that girl,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;the better I like her. And we have been
awfully silly&mdash;that&#8217;s a fact. The next time I
see her I shall tell her so too. Now suppose
we go and do a little studying our own
selves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Somehow or other before Thanksgiving Day,
Robbie Belle Sanders had ceased to be disappointed
in college. With Berta for a dearest
friend and Miss Cutter withdrawn to a more
congenial neighborhood, she was finding it
even more fun than she had expected.

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>A QUESTION OF ECONOMY</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>I love</span> music myself,&#8221; said Robbie Belle,
lifting serene eyes from her porridge, &#8220;but to-day
is Thanksgiving Day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; sighed Berta, as she clasped her
hands&mdash;those thin nervous hands with the
long fingers that Robbie Belle admired all the
more for their contrast with her own dimpled
ones, &#8220;think of hearing Caruso and Sembrich
together in grand opera! I could walk all
the way on my knees.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; cried Robbie Belle in wide-eyed
astonishment, her spoon half way to her
mouth, &#8220;walk seventy miles! And miss the
Dinner?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The graduate fellow at the head of their
table looked quite sad as she nodded her
pretty head, though to be sure her napkin was
hiding her lips.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why!&#8221; gasped Robbie Belle, freshman,
&#8220;but Dinner is to begin at three and last till
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
almost six. And we are going to have salted
almonds and nesselrode pudding and raw oysters
and chocolate peppermints and turkey
and sherbet and macaroons and nuts and
celery and Brussels sprouts and everything.
We are painting the place-cards this morning
and one is for you. It is a shame for you to
sacrifice it just to hear grand opera, Miss
Bonner. Are you really intending to take
the nine o&#8217;clock train?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again the fellow nodded. Robbie Belle&#8217;s
wondering gaze rested a moment on Berta&#8217;s
gypsy face alight now with an intensity of
longing. Deliberately depositing her spoon
on one side of her saucer and her buttered bit
of roll on the other she devoted her entire
attention to this marvel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot understand,&#8221; she said clearly, &#8220;it
is only singing. And to-day is Thanksgiving
Day. It comes once a year.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Bonner brushed her napkin across her
mouth rather hurriedly and excused herself
from the table. Robbie Belle watched her
retreating down the long vista of the dining-room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you honestly choose to go with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
her if you could, Berta?&#8221; she asked, &#8220;grand
opera is only something to see and hear and
then it is all over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Robbie Belle!&#8221; groaned Berta, &#8220;how
about the Dinner? That is only something
to eat, and then it is all over too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you go if you want to?&#8221; inquired
Robbie Belle as she reflectively picked
up her roll again. &#8220;We can invite somebody
else to take your place at the table. Bea and
Lila are going to the hothouse for smilax and
chrysanthemums.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t I go?&#8221; Berta leaned back
and drew a long and melancholy sigh from the
bottom of her boots. &#8220;Girls,&#8221; she turned to
the others who were still lingering over their
breakfast, &#8220;she asks why I don&#8217;t go to hear
grand opera. And it costs two dollars railroad
fare even on a commutation ticket, and
seats are three dollars up, and I have precisely
thirty-seven cents to last me till Christmas.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; commented Robbie Belle repentantly,
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think. I&#8217;d love to pay for all of
you, only I haven&#8217;t any money either.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Berta clutched at her heart and bent double
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
in a bow of gratitude unspeakable. Robbie
Belle continued to stare at her thoughtfully.
&#8220;If you truly want to, Berta, we might save
up and go to the opera some other day. I&#8217;m
willing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Willing! Dear child! Willing! Behold
how she immolates herself upon the altar of
friendship! She is willing to go to grand
opera and sit listening to sweet sounds from
dawn to dark&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Berta!&#8221; interrupting in alarm, &#8220;not
from dawn to dark really? How about&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Luncheon?&#8221; the other caught up the
sentence tragically. &#8220;Ah, no, but calm thyself,
dear one. Be serene&mdash;as usual. There is
an intermission for luncheon. We could go to
a restaurant. It would be a restaurant with a
vinegar cruet in the centre of the table and
plates of thick bread at each end and lovely
little oyster crackers for the soup. Perhaps
if you had two dollars extra you might order
terrapin.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And pickles,&#8221; put in Bea generously,
&#8220;with striped ice-cream.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And angel food with chocolate frosting an
inch thick,&#8221; contributed Lila.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a long time till spring,&#8221; said Robbie
Belle regretfully, &#8220;but very likely we will
need all that while to save it up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As it turned out, they did need all that
while to save it up. For beauty-loving Berta
with her eternally slim purse and hopelessly
meagre account-book, the plan at first seemed
only a vision of the moment. Nobody can
save out of nothing, can she? Robbie Belle,
however, had a stubborn fashion of clinging
to an idea when once it became fixed. Her
ideas, furthermore, were apt to be clean-cut
and definite. This is how she reasoned it
out:
</p>
<p>If a girl receives five dollars a month from
home to pay for books and postage and incidentals,
she is entitled to whatever she saves
from the allowance. Every time this girl refrains
from writing a letter, she has really
saved two cents or the value of the stamp, to
say nothing of the paper. Whenever she
walks down town instead of riding, she has a
right to the nickel to add to the fund in the
back of her top bureau drawer. If she buys
a ten-cent fountain-pen instead of a dollar one,
she virtually earns ninety cents. If she rents
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
a grammar for twenty-five cents instead of
paying one dollar and a half for a new book,
she is a thrifty person who deserves the difference.
Every time she declines&mdash;mournfully&mdash;to
drop in at the restaurant for dinner with
a crowd of friends, or refuses to join in a waffle-supper,
Dutch treat, she is so much nearer
being a melancholy and noble capitalist.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s all right for you,&#8221; assented
Berta airily when told of this working theory,
&#8220;but supposing you don&#8217;t have the money to
save in the first place? I fail to receive five
dollars a month from home or even one dollar
invariably; and I always walk to town and
never enter the restaurant except to wait while
you save ten cents by buying half a pound of
caramels when you want to buy a whole
pound.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re forty cents a pound, Berta,&#8221; objected
scrupulous Robbie Belle. &#8220;I really
saved twenty cents yesterday, you see.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, of course, how distressingly inaccurate
of me. And I also&mdash;I saved five dollars
and fourteen cents by using my wash-stand
for a writing-table instead of buying that
bargain desk for four dollars and ninety-eight
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
cents. The extra fifteen was saved on the inkwell
I did not buy either. I say, Robbie
Belle Sanders, let&#8217;s save the entire sum by
denying ourselves that set of Browning we
saw last week.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Robbie Belle looked grieved. &#8220;You always
make fun of everything. You act as if you
didn&#8217;t care.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Berta turned away for a minute, and stood
gazing from the window of her little tower
room. The window was small and high, but
the view was wide and wonderful toward the
purple hills in the west. At length she said
something under her breath. Robbie Belle
heard it and understood. It was only, &#8220;I&#8217;m
afraid.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Robbie Belle knew that Berta was afraid of
caring too much. She had listened once in
twilight confidence under the pines to the
story of how Berta had been all ready to start
for college three years before, when a sudden
family misfortune changed her plans and condemned
her to immediate teaching. In the
bitterness of her disappointment she had
vowed never to set her heart on any plan
again.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></p>
<p>Walking over to Berta&#8217;s side Robbie Belle
took the listless hand in both her comforting
ones.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if we shouldn&#8217;t manage it this year,
you know, we could try again next year. We
might earn something extra during the summer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Next year!&#8221; echoed Berta under her
breath. &#8220;I can&#8217;t count on next year&mdash;I dare
not. You do not understand, for your scholarship
is certain through the course, while mine
depends on what Prexie thinks I am worth.
I am under the eye of the faculty. Don&#8217;t
talk about next year. I am pretending that
this is the last time I shall be here in October,
then in November, then in December. I look
at everything&mdash;the lake, the trees, the girls, the
teachers, the dear, dear library, and say,
&#8216;Good-bye! Good-bye, my college year.&#8217;
They may not help me to come back, you
know. If I really try not to expect it, I will
not be disappointed in any case. Of course,
I am not worth four hundred dollars to them.
I am afraid to hope for it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you are the brightest student here.
Bea says so and you know it!&#8221; exclaimed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
Robbie Belle indignantly; &#8220;there isn&#8217;t any
question about your being granted another
scholarship when you apply for it next spring.
They weigh everything&mdash;intellect, personality,
character, conduct. Never you fear. If they
give only one scholarship in the whole college,
it shall be to you. You are superstitious:
you fancy that if you do your best to expect
the worst, the best will happen, because it is
always the unexpected that happens. Only
of course, that isn&#8217;t true at all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Berta was smiling mistily around into the
fair face. &#8220;Dear old Robbie Belle! Will
Shakespeare was right&mdash;&#8216;there&#8217;s flattery in
friendship&#8217;&mdash;it makes me rejoice. The
trouble, you see, sweetheart, lies in my character.
I misdoubt me that Prexie will spurn
my plea if he hears how often we have a
meeting of the fudge club at a tax of two
cents per head. Let&#8217;s save up that two cents
for the Opera fund.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Robbie Belle drew a deep sigh. &#8220;All
right,&#8221; she agreed with a doleful glance toward
the particular blue plate in which she
was accustomed to pour her share of the
delicacy. &#8220;Anyway the doctor calls fudge an
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
&#8216;abomination.&#8217; Bea will scold because she
hates scrimping. But then she doesn&#8217;t care so
much as we do for music unless it is convenient.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Berta&#8217;s contributions were the result of
more active exertions than the other&#8217;s passive
self-denial. She sat up one night till two
o&#8217;clock to dress a doll. Every fall a few
hundred dolls were distributed to be dressed
by the girls for the Christmas tree at the Settlement
House in the city. Some of the
students took dolls and paid other girls to
make the clothes. Berta earned a dollar by
helping Bea with the three which that impulsive
young woman had rashly undertaken.
In February she composed valentines and sold
them to over-busy maidens who felt unequal
to rhyming in the reaction after the midyear
examinations. In March she painted Easter
eggs and in April she arranged pots of growing
ferns and flowers from the woods. By
May the fund was complete and the tickets
were bought.
</p>
<p>As the longed-for event drew nearer,
Berta made a string of paper dolls and joyfully
tore off one for each passing day.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span></p>
<p>At last the morning dawned. Robbie Belle
was dreaming that she had fallen asleep in
fifth hour Latin. It seemed as if the instructor
called her name and then came walking
down from the platform, thump, thump,
thump, in her broad-soled shoes. It was unladylike
to thump so heavily, thought Robbie
Belle in the midst of her confused dismay over
having lost the place in the text as well as
forgotten the translation. The thumping
sharpened to a rat-tat-tat upon the bedroom
door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Robbie Belle, Robbie Belle, you lazybones!
The night watchman has knocked
twice already. Get up, get up this instant!
We&#8217;re going to hear Grand Opera to-day!
O-o-ooh!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Robbie Belle lifted her head to listen.
&#8220;Berta Abbott, you&#8217;ve got a chill. I hear you
shivering. Hurry into your clothes this
minute. I&#8217;ll bring you the quinine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Quinine! Berta shivering from excitement
laughed softly to herself. Dear old Robbie
Belle! Quinine on this wonderful day!
Listen! That was the twittering of swallows
under the eaves. A squirrel peered in at her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
window, his bright eyes twinkling. It was too
bad that he did not enjoy music. But perhaps
he did after all. Hark! that was a
robin. And listen! There sounded the full-throated
whistle of a brown thrush. The
world was ringing with music&mdash;beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful! And she was going to
hear Grand Opera to-day! That had been her
most precious dream next to coming to college.
To come to college and to hear Grand Opera
too!
</p>
<p>&#8220;My cup runneth over! My cup runneth
over,&#8221; she chanted softly to herself, while
from Robbie Belle&#8217;s room rose a faint noise of
deliberate dressing, subdued splashing, slow
steps, a rustling that was almost methodical in
its rhythm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Berta,&#8221; she announced, appearing with
hat set straight and firm over her smooth dark
hair, her coat over one arm, her umbrella
neatly strapped, &#8220;I think I shall carry my
Horace, for it is a two-hours&#8217; ride, and to-day
is Saturday and after Sunday comes Monday.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Berta clapped her hands over her ears,
&#8220;Go away, go away to your breakfast, miserable
creature! Horace! that worldly wise old
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
Roman! With the river before your eyes, the
beautiful river in May!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The next ode begins, &#8216;O Fons Bandusiæ!&#8217;&mdash;a
fountain, you understand,&#8221; protested
Robbie Belle in injured tones, &#8220;he loved
the country. I wanted to read it aloud to
you and get in my practice on scansion
that way. I am learning to do it quite well.
Listen! &#8216;Splendidior vitro-o-o,&#8217;&#8221; she declaimed,
dragging out the syllables to lugubrious
length.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Robbie Belle,&#8221; murmured Berta
pleasantly, &#8220;if you breathe one line of that
stuff on this journey I shall throw you into
the river myself&mdash;cheerfully.&#8221; She nodded
vigorous approval of her own sentiments, and
her contrary hair seized the opportunity to
tumble down again in resentment of impatient
fingers. &#8220;Oh, Robbie Belle, come and twist
this up for me, won&#8217;t you? We shall be late
for the train. I don&#8217;t believe we care for
breakfast anyhow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not care for breakfast!&#8221; Robbie Belle
shut her mouth determinedly. She walked
over to the wardrobe, pinned Berta&#8217;s hat
securely on the fly-away hair, caught up her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
jacket, tucked the tickets into her own pocket,
and sternly marched her scatter-brained friend
out of the room and down the corridor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s gone to her head,&#8221; she muttered sadly
as if communing with herself, &#8220;the idea
of music has gone to her head. I must address
her soothingly. Yes, yes, we&#8217;re going&mdash;we&#8217;re
going soon, don&#8217;t worry. But we&#8217;re
a-going clothed and in our right mind&mdash;mine
at least, and fed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>On tiptoe they flitted down to the big
empty dining-room. A special breakfast was
being served to the dozen or more students
who intended to take the early train to the
city. The unaccustomed stillness in the vast
apartment usually vibrating with clatter of
dishes and chatter of tongues seemed dreamlike
to Berta in her exalted mood. Robbie
Belle found it necessary to exert her firmest
authority in order to get Berta to eat even a
roll and swallow a cup of chocolate.
</p>
<p>Two of the seniors who were going shopping
lamented that they had neglected to
apply for opera tickets until the house had
been sold out. Berta gazed at them pityingly.
To have the money and to be in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
city, and yet not to be able to go! Why
hadn&#8217;t they thought of it in time? She had
anticipated it years in advance. This world
was full of queer people&mdash;all sorts of people
who did not care for music, and even some
who did not care for books. Wasn&#8217;t it the
strangest thing&mdash;not to care!
</p>
<p>When somebody consulting her watch announced
that the special electric car was to
leave the Lodge Gates for the station in seven
minutes, Berta dropped spoon and napkin
in eager haste to depart. Out into the corridor
and around the balusters to the messenger
room where they were required to register
their names and destination. At the foot of
the broad staircase hung the bulletin board in
the pale flicker of a lowered gas-jet. The
morning light was brightening through the
windows beyond. Berta halted mechanically
to scan the oblong of dark red in search
of possible new notices. Something may have
been posted since chapel last night.
</p>
<p>Ah, yes, there was a fresh square of white
tucked under the tapes that marked the felt
into convenient diamonds. Berta read it at a
glance.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></p>
<p>&#8220;All students requiring financial assistance
for the coming year are requested to make
written application to the President before
May 10th. It is understood that those receiving
such aid will exercise all reasonable economy
in avoiding unnecessary expenditure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Berta did not move, though her mobile
face seemed to harden in a curiously stony
expression. She read the notice again. Robbie
Belle came breezily from the messenger
room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything new, Berta? You look queer.&#8221;
She followed the direction of the fascinated
eyes. She read it slowly and drew a deep
breath.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So we can&#8217;t go after all,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>Berta seemed to wake up suddenly from
a trance. &#8220;Robbie Belle!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t help it,&#8221; doggedly though the
smooth forehead had clouded in a quick frown
of pain at the cry, &#8220;it would not be honest.
I didn&#8217;t know before.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s our own money,&#8221; protested Berta
defiantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But our scholarships are the same as borrowed.&#8221;
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></div>
<p>&#8220;The tickets are bought and paid for.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Robbie Belle caught a glimpse of figures
emerging from the dining-room. &#8220;There
come those two seniors who forgot to get seats
in advance. Isn&#8217;t it lucky! Now we can sell
them ours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me my ticket,&#8221; demanded Berta&#8217;s
voice sullenly, &#8220;you never cared.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But it is not honest,&#8221; repeated Robbie
Belle stubbornly. &#8220;I never thought of it in
that light before. It is not honest to spend
five dollars and more for a luxury while we
are living on borrowed money.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Give&mdash;me&mdash;my&mdash;ticket.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The seniors rustled past. To Berta their
laughter sounded far away. &#8220;Oh, girls, we&#8217;ll
have to hurry! Hear that bell jangle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The conductor does it on purpose to see
us run. We have three minutes yet. Those
two freshmen by the bulletin-board are
going.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not honest,&#8221; said Robbie Belle.
</p>
<p>Fragments of gay chatter floated back to
them. &#8220;Caruso and Sembrich in Lucia di
Lammermoor! Fancy! It is the most wonderful
combination of extraordinary talent&mdash;genius.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
I shall certainly go if I have to stand
up every minute of the three hours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is simply wicked to miss such an opportunity.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Important part of our education, isn&#8217;t it?
I only wish my thesis were on the &#8216;Development
of the Drama.&#8217; I should employ the
laboratory method most assuredly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The critics say that such a chance as
this does not occur more than once in a
century.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not honest,&#8221; said Robbie Belle, back
in the shadowy corridor before the bulletin-board.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you give me my ticket?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Robbie Belle flinched before the passionate
low tones, and the roseleaf color in her cheeks
went quite white. She handed Berta both
tickets. &#8220;You may do what you like with
mine,&#8221; she said and turned slowly away.
</p>
<p>Berta fled in the wake of the hurrying
seniors. Her head buzzed with frantic arguments.
It was her own money&mdash;she had
earned it. Nobody had a right to dictate
what she should do with it. Robbie Belle
never could see more than one side of a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
question. To forbid unnecessary expenditure
just because she accepted a loan to carry her
through college! Who was to say whether it
was unnecessary or not? The Opera was part
of her musical education. She would repay
the scholarship with interest at the earliest
possible date after she began to earn a salary.
What meddling insolence! The girls who
held scholarships were the brightest and
finest in college&mdash;some of them. And to
treat them as if they were extravagant, silly
little spendthrifts! It was honest. Hadn&#8217;t
she denied herself everything all the
year&mdash;clubs and dinners and drives and
flowers and ribbons and gloves and new
books and fine note-paper and that cast of
the Winged Victory which she had wanted
and wanted and wanted? Not that she assumed
any credit for such self-denial&mdash;it
simply had to be, that was all. But now,
this was different. She owed it to herself
not to miss such a wonderful occasion. A
chance in a century&mdash;that was what the senior
said.
</p>
<p>Ting-aling, ting-aling! jangled the bell
madly. The conductor paused, his hand on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
the strap. A breathless girl sprang upon the
platform, darted into the car, tossed a packet
upon a convenient lap.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are two seats for the Opera. We
can&#8217;t go.&#8221; And she had leaped from the
moving steps and vanished through the great
iron gates of the Lodge.
</p>
<p>Back in the dormitory before the bulletin-board
Miss Bonner, the graduate fellow, was
staring at the new placard. She gave a slight
start of astonishment at a glimpse of Berta
hastening past her. Then because she had
heard the story from Robbie Belle two minutes
earlier, she pretended to be absorbed in
the notices, for she suspected that any comment
would start the tears that Berta was
holding back. However, she was smiling to
herself after the girl had vanished up the
stairs. When the gong struck for breakfast,
she halted at the faculty table to whisper a
few words to the professor in her special department.
The professor answered, &#8220;How
glad I am!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you really believe that it would have
prejudiced the scholarship committee against
Miss Abbott, if she had persisted in this extravagance?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
She has worked so hard to
earn it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; the professor was sympathetic
but unswerving from her convictions;
&#8220;it seems somewhat cruel when one considers
how passionately fond of music the child is.
Still you must remember that this scholarship
fund is the result of endless self-denial. I
have known several alumnæ, to say the least,
who have sacrificed greater privileges than
visits to the Opera for the sake of contributing
an extra mite. Would it be just for
one who benefits from the economy of others
to spend in self-indulgence?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Meanwhile Berta, unconscious of the fact
that her whole college career and the future
to be moulded by it had depended upon her
decision to do right in this apparently insignificant
respect, had trudged up to a certain
lonely room. Robbie Belle lifted a wet face
from a consoling pillow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Berta!&#8221; It was like a soft little shout of
triumph. &#8220;I knew&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Berta swallowed a lump in her throat and
managed to smile a whimsical smile from behind
dewy lashes.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe we&#8217;ll have clam chowder for luncheon,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;and then won&#8217;t those two
seniors be sorry!&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>HER FRESHMAN VALENTINES</h3>
</div>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>When</span> Bea straightened her head from its
anxious tilt over the desk, she drew the tip of
her tongue from its perilous position between
two rows of white teeth, and heaved a mighty
sigh of relief.
</p>
<p>Then she blinked admiringly upon the
white pile of envelopes lying in the glow of
the drop-light. &#8220;There! That makes fifteen
valentines all for her. She will be sure to receive
more than any other senior, and that
will teach Berta Abbott a thing or two. The
idea of her insisting that her senior is more
popular than my senior!&#8221;
</p>
<p>With a smile that was rather more sleepy
than dreamy, the industrious young freshman
picked up the precious missives.
</p>
<p>&#8220;O Lila,&mdash;my magnanimous roommate,&mdash;are
you asleep? Do you want to listen to my
last valentines? I intend to run down and
put them in the senior caldron presently. Is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
this sentimental? When I read it to Berta,
she laughed at it.
</p>
<div class='ce'>

</td></tr></table>

<p>At this point an open umbrella, which hid
the pillow on the farther narrow bed, gave a
convulsive shiver, and a fretful voice complained:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you turn off that gas and stop your
nonsense? Here it is midnight, if it&#8217;s an
hour, and I haven&#8217;t slept a wink, with that
light blazing. I know I shall fail in the written
test to-morrow, Valentine&#8217;s day or not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bea stared pensively at the Topsy-like
corona above the flushed face. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe
she ever puts her hair up in curlers now,
do you? She is superior to such vanities, and
anyway, it is naturally curly, you know, and
that probably makes a difference. I wonder
if she even stoops to making verses. Do you
suppose she sends valentines to other girls?
Of course, she doesn&#8217;t care a snap whether
she receives more than any, and is declared
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
the most popular senior. H&#8217;m-m-m!&#8221; drifting
into reverie afresh. &#8220;I dare say I could
compose a poem on that idea. For instance:
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;I know a senior all sedate&mdash;&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>The umbrella bounced tempestuously across
the floor, and was followed by a pillow driven
hard and straight at a tousled head that
ducked just in time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;U-huh!&#8221; ferociously. &#8220;Well,
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;I know a freshman, sure as fate!</p>

<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>Because her long-suffering roommate&mdash;&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Here the gas flared suddenly into darkness,
and slippered feet scurried away from the
desk. The door opened and shut quickly;
and Bea, her valentines clutched safely against
her dressing gown, was speeding through the
dark corridors toward the senior parlor.
There a kettle, overflowing with bits of
white, swung from a tripod before the
shadowy folds of the parlor portières.
</p>
<p>Ah! Bea, bending toward the caldron with
arm extended, stiffened without moving.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
She had heard something. Yes, there it was
again&mdash;a muffled footfall on the stairs near
by. Hark! Down the black shaft from the
cave above came stealing a second slender
figure in a flowing robe of some pale woolly
stuff. In her hands also was clasped a packet
of envelopes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Berta!&#8221; Bea said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, good-morning, Miss Leigh!&#8221; responded
Berta, advancing with a tread the
stateliness of which was somewhat impaired
by a loosely flapping sole. &#8220;Did you rise
early in order to prepare for the Latin test?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bea brushed aside the query with the contempt
it deserved. &#8220;Are all those for your
senior? I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s fair for you to
copy verses out of any old book, while every
one of mine is original; and yet yours count
exactly as much. Well, anyway, I wouldn&#8217;t
send my senior anything that was ordinary
and unworthy of her acceptance. How many
have you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>This ignoble curiosity was likewise ignored
by Miss Berta, who proceeded with dignified
slowness to drop her valentines one by one
into the caldron. Bea, with lingering care,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
deposited her contribution on the very top.
One slid over the edge, and in rescuing it she
disturbed a fold of the portière. A glimpse
within set her eyes to sparkling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Berta, there&#8217;s an open fire in the senior
parlor, and it&#8217;s still red!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ho,&#8221; whispered Berta, in reply to the unspoken
challenge, &#8220;I&#8217;m not afraid! Let&#8217;s,&#8221;
and two flowing, woolly robes glided into
the warm room, with its heart of glowing
coals. One bold intruder nestled in the biggest
arm-chair, the other fumbled for the
tongs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t we wicked! Robbie wouldn&#8217;t do
it.&#8221; Berta cuddled deeper among the comforting
cushions. &#8220;But&mdash;oh!&mdash;doesn&#8217;t it feel
good in here!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bea poked a coal until it split into a faint
blue blaze. &#8220;We&#8217;re worse than wicked.
We&#8217;re cheeky,&mdash;that&#8217;s what,&mdash;coming into
this room without being invited. Suppose
some senior should discover us!&#8221; She
paused, smitten by the terror of the new
thought. &#8220;Just suppose my senior should
find me here! She has a horror of anything
underhanded or sly. I should die of shame!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
It was a genuine groan, and Berta was too
startled to laugh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess it isn&#8217;t very nice of us,&#8221; she acknowledged
meekly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going this instant.&#8221; Bea&#8217;s hand was
on the portière when a rustling in the kettle
caught her attention. Through a rift between
the folds she spied lace ruffles about a delicate
hand that was dropping envelopes down upon
the others. Over the tripod a face appeared
for one moment in the dim light, and then
was gone. Light steps retreated swiftly, and
a door closed not far away on the senior corridor.
Bea had recognized her senior.
</p>
<p>When the two midnight visitors stole
timorously forth a moment later, Bea&#8217;s eyes
traveled wistfully toward the big envelope lying
squarely on top of all the valentines.
</p>
<p>Berta regarded her keenly. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t
you march up and read the name, if you
want to so much?&#8221; was her blunt question.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She must be pretty fond of somebody,&#8221;
whispered Bea, &#8220;if she stayed up till now
just to write valentines for her. I wish&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think it is sneaking to look?&#8221;
persisted Berta. &#8220;If she objected to having
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
it seen, she might have turned it address
down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is address down,&#8221; murmured Bea, sadly,
&#8220;and I know it would be dishonorable to try
to see it. She herself would call any act like
that contemptible.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At this crisis Berta sneezed&mdash;sneezed hard
and long and with suspicious vehemence.
And when Bea cast one lingering farewell
glance toward the caldron, she perceived that
the topmost missives were sliding over the
edge in the breeze raised by that gusty sneeze.
The big square envelope tumbled clumsily
down upon its back and lay staring, quite close
to the flickering gas. Bea&#8217;s wilful eyes rested
on it one illuminating instant, and then leaped
away, while her cheeks whitened suddenly.
The name on the valentine was that of the
senior herself.
</p>
<p>Poor little Bea! After the first dazed moment
she began to select and gather up the fifteen
valentines which she had deposited five
minutes before.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Beatrice Leigh!&#8221; gasped Berta.
&#8220;You haven&#8217;t any right to take them back
after you have mailed them!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you imagine for one moment that I
shall give valentines to a girl who sends them
to herself? And the senior who receives the
most is declared the most popular in the
class!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;but,&#8221; stammered Berta, &#8220;perhaps she
thought&mdash;perhaps she didn&#8217;t think&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I was afraid a girl who could do a
thing like that might blame us for entering
the senior parlor uninvited!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bea&#8217;s hands fell listlessly at her sides as
she walked away. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care,&#8221; she said.
And Berta, who was wise in some unexpected
ways, wondered why people always said
they did not care just when they cared the
most.
</p>
<p>Next day various anonymous verses were
delivered at the door where Lila Allan
wrestled with the rules for indirect discourse,
while her roommate, chin in hand, stared
gloomily out at the snow-darkened sky.
Valentines were silly, anyway, and it was a
shame for any one to waste time and energy
in hunting foolish rhymes for eyes and hair
and smiles and hearts. How could a person be
sure about anybody, if a girl with a face like
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
a white flower could send valentines to herself
with the address side down?
</p>
<p>All day long the senior caldron bubbled
notes faithfully till the very last minute.
After chapel the class fluttered into their little
parlor, with its fire blazing merrily and its
shaded lamps glowing. Somebody, disguised
in a long gray beard and flowing gray robe,
stalked in amid laughter and clapping, and
began to distribute the contents of the kettle.
</p>
<p>Berta, hanging at a perilous angle over the
stairway just outside, felt some one halt
silently beside her, and glanced up into Bea&#8217;s
eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; she said, in an excited whisper.
&#8220;Can you see all right, Bea? I think she has
called my senior&#8217;s name about twenty times
already. Look how the valentines are heaped
in her lap! Where&#8217;s your senior?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That person with the gray beard,&#8221; began
Bea, calmly, only to be interrupted by,
&#8220;Why, so it is! What fun! Where does she
put the envelopes addressed to herself? Oh,
yes, I see. Why&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Berta caught Bea&#8217;s
skirts in a firm grasp. &#8220;See here, young
lady, you&#8217;ll go over the banisters head first if
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
you don&#8217;t undouble yourself pretty soon.
You&#8217;ll&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the very valentine&mdash;that big, square
envelope in her hand this instant! She sent
it to herself&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bea saw Saint Valentine read aloud the
name, and then stop short, staring at the address
in a puzzled way. She turned the envelope
over to examine its back, and study
the waxen seal. Suddenly she bent her head
in the delighted laughter that Bea once had
thought so charming. She laughed till the
long gray beard threatened to shake itself free.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that the greatest joke! I was scribbling
verses last night till I was too sleepy to
see straight. I didn&#8217;t mean to send this to
myself. How perfectly ridiculous!&#8221; and she
tossed the innocent missive into the fire.
</p>
<p>Outside on the shadowy stairway Berta gave
a little squeal of pain. &#8220;Ouch! You&#8217;re
pinching me black and blue! Why, Bea, Bea
Leigh, whatever in the world&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>A packet of white, bound with an elastic,
went flying through the air, to fall with a
rustling plop into the half-empty caldron.
An inquisitive senior going out to investigate
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
spied only the deserted stairs, and heard nothing
but four scampering feet on the corridor
overhead. Saint Valentine, with a voice that
dropped lower and lower into a muffled murmur,
read her own name fifteen times in succession,
and blushed rose-pink, from gray
beard to powdered hair, while the other seniors
laughed and laughed.
</p>
<p>Two minutes after the valentines had been
counted and the result announced Bea was
waltzing about Berta&#8217;s room, with that unwilling
captive in her arms.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ho! Who says your senior is more popular
than my senior now?&#8221; she jeered. &#8220;Who
won that time, I want to know?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Before I&#8217;d have a senior who sends valentines
to herself!&#8221; grumbled Berta wickedly, to
the ceiling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ho!&#8221; chanted shameless Bea. &#8220;I knew
it was a mistake all along. That&#8217;s the reason
I didn&#8217;t tear up my valentines.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; commented Miss Berta, with an inflection
so maddening that in three seconds
she was fleeing for her life.

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>THE GIFTIE GIE US</h3>
</div>

<p>It had been raining for a week. Berta was
writing a poem, her elbows on the desk, her
hair clutched in one hand, her pen in the
other. At the window Robbie Belle was
working happily over her curve-tracing, now
and then drawing back to gaze with admiration
at the sweeping lines of her problem.
Once the slanting beat of the drops against
the pane caught her eye, and she paused for a
moment to consider their angle of incidence.
She decided that she liked curves better than
angles. She did not wonder why, as Berta
would have done, but having recognized the
fact of preference turned placidly back to her
instruments.
</p>
<p>Splash! came a fiercer gust of rain, and
Berta stirred uneasily, tossing her head as if
striving subconsciously to shake off a vague
irritation of hearing. Another heavier sound
was mingling with the steady patter. Rub-a-dub-dub,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
rub-a-dub-dub! Robbie Belle
glanced up and listened, her pencil uplifted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Bea,&#8221; she said, &#8220;she&#8217;s drumming with
her knuckles on the floor in the corridor.
She says that it is against her principles to
knock on the door when it has an engaged
sign on it. Shall I say come?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Apparently Berta did not hear the question.
With her chin grasped firmly in one
fist, she was staring very hard at a corner of
the ceiling where there was nothing in particular.
Robbie looked at her and sighed,
but the resignation in the sigh was transfigured
by loving awe. She picked up her
pencil in patient acquiescence. Berta must
not be disturbed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Chir-awhirr, chir-awhirr, tweet, tweet,
tweet!&#8221; It was Bea&#8217;s best soprano, with several
extra trills strewn between the consonants.
&#8220;Listen to the mocking-bird. Oh, the mocking-bird
is singing on the bough. Bravo,
encore! Chir-awhirr! Encore!

<p>Robbie Belle was leaning back in her chair
to listen in serene enjoyment. She loved to
hear Bea sing. Berta was listening, too, but
with an absent expression, as if still in a
dream.
</p>
<p>The voice outside the door declared itself
again. &#8220;Ahem, written by Bliss Carmen.
Sung by Beatrice Leigh. Ahem!&#8221; It was a
noticeably emphatic ahem, and certainly deserved
a more appreciative reply than continued
silence from within. After a minute&#8217;s
inviting pause, the singer piped up
afresh.

<p>The concluding cough was so successfully
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
convulsive that Robbie Belle&#8217;s mouth opened
suddenly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be something important,&#8221; she
said.
</p>
<p>Berta woke up from her trance. &#8220;Come!&#8221;
she called.
</p>
<p>At the first breath of the syllable, the door
flew open with a specially prepared bang, and
Bea shot in with an instantaneous and voluntary
velocity that carried her to the centre of
the rug.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, girls!&#8221; she exclaimed in the excited
tone of a breathless and delighted messenger
bringing great and astonishing news, &#8220;it&#8217;s
raining!&#8221;
</p>
<p>In the ensuing stillness, she could almost
hear the disgusted thud of expectation dashed
to earth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Villain!&#8221; said Berta, and swung around
to her interrupted poem.
</p>
<p>Robbie&#8217;s puzzled stare developed slowly
into a smile. &#8220;I think that is a joke,&#8221; she
said.
</p>
<p>Then Bea laughed. She collapsed on the
sofa and shook from her boots to her curls.
It was contagious laughter that made Robbie
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
chuckle in sympathy and Berta grin broadly
at a discreet pigeon-hole of her desk. When
the visitor resumed sufficient self-possession to
enable her to enunciate, she sat up and inquired
anxiously,
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you hear me sing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Berta regarded her solemnly. &#8220;We did,&#8221;
she answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Robbie Belle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to do. I&#8217;m
going to change. I&#8217;m going to be made over,
Mother April. I&#8217;m going to turn into a
genius for a while. I&#8217;ve always wanted to be
a genius. It&#8217;s no fun to be systematic and
steady and conscientious, and so forth, is it,
Robbie Belle? At least it isn&#8217;t very much
fun, considering what might be done with our
opportunities. So I intend to behave as if I
had an artistic temperament. I am going to
let my work pile up, cut late, skip meals,
break engagements, never answer letters, give
in to moods, be generally irresponsible, and so
forth, just like Berta. I&#8217;m going to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bea laughed again mischievously at the
sound of outraged dignity in Berta&#8217;s voice.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
&#8220;Yes, I am. I have the spring fever: I don&#8217;t
want to do anything, and I don&#8217;t want to do
nothing either. In fact, this is the single
solitary thing I do want to do. That&#8217;s the
reason why it will be so agreeable to be a
genius. At least, it will be agreeable to
me, if not to my contemporaries and companions.
I shall do exactly as I please at
the moment. Another reason will be the
thrill of novelty&mdash;I&#8217;m simply dying for excitement.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thrill of novelty!&#8221; groaned Berta. &#8220;I
infer that you never do as you please. You
continually &#8216;sackerifice&#8217; yourself&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, of course, but I was afraid you
hadn&#8217;t noticed.&#8221; Bea raised her fingers to
smooth the corners of her mouth straight.
&#8220;Now, you&#8217;ve been growing worse&mdash;I mean,
more and more of a genius ever since entering
college. I myself ought to be called Prexie&#8217;s
Assistant, somewhat after the order of Miss
Edgeworth&#8217;s &#8216;Parent&#8217;s Assistant,&#8217; you know,
because my career has been such an awful
warning to the undergraduate. But you&#8217;re an
example&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not a genius,&#8221; Berta spoke with biting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
severity of accent; &#8220;Lucine Brett is a
genius, and I despise her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You used to despise her,&#8221; put in Robbie
Belle gently.
</p>
<p>Berta caught her lip between her teeth for
a fleeting instant of irritation, for she was not
naturally meek. Then she glanced at Robbie
with a quick smile all the sweeter for the
under-throb of repentance over her impatient
impulse. &#8220;All right, I used to long ago.
But to return to our guest. I am not a genius,
I hasten to remark again. Furthermore I
shall be excessively obliged if Miss Leigh will
march out of this apartment and stay where
she belongs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In the pause which was occupied by Bea in
considering a choice of retorts stupendous,
Robbie spoke again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Bea misses Lila while she is in the
infirmary,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>Bea swung magnificently on her heel. &#8220;I
have decided that the proper rejoinder is a
crushing silence. I wish you good afternoon.&#8221;
At the door she halted. &#8220;And I shall be a
genius for a spell. You just watch me and
see. Shelley was lawless, you know, and
Burns and Carlyle, I guess, and Goethe and
George Eliot&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<a name='linki_4' id='linki_4'></a>
<img src='images/img-099.jpg' alt='' title='' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
&#8220;OH, THANK YOU; I DON&#8217;T WANT ANYTHING TO EAT&#8221;
<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></div>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was a shout of such indignation that
Bea vanished instanter. A moment later she
poked her head around the lintel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they were,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and so are
you. It is a marvel to me how you hoodwink
Prexie about your work. Pure luck! Vale!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Berta&#8217;s repartee consisted of a sofa pillow
aimed accurately at the diminishing crack.
</p>
<p>The next day was Saturday. Bea failed to
appear at breakfast&mdash;a catastrophe which had
not occurred before in the memory of the
oldest junior. Berta who usually arrived herself
half an hour late headed a procession of
inquiring friends, three of whom bore glasses
of milk and plates of rolls to supply the dire
omission. A succession of crescendo taps at
her door was at length rewarded by a drowsy-eyed
apparition in bath-robe and worsted slippers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, thank&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she exclaimed at sight of
the sympathetic group, and suddenly remembered
that she must be different from her ordinary
self. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want anything to eat.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
I didn&#8217;t feel exactly like getting up early. I
seem to prefer to be alone this morning.&#8221;
And she managed, though with a hand that
faltered at the misdeed, to shut the door in
their astonished faces.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I never!&#8221; &#8220;What has happened?&#8221;
&#8220;Was it a telegram?&#8221; &#8220;How perfectly
atrocious!&#8221; &#8220;Is she sick?&#8221; &#8220;Beatrice Leigh
to treat us with such unutterable rudeness!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Berta listened with a queer little smile on
her sensitively cut lips. Once she noticed a
hasty twist of the knob as if Bea had snatched
at it from the other side under the prick of
the comments floating over the transom. As
she walked slowly away the smile faded before
a shadowing recollection. She was
wondering if her own manner had truly been
so unpardonable on that autumn morning
when Robbie had carried her a baked apple
with cream on it and plum bread besides. It
had certainly been irritating to be interrupted
in the middle of that rondel for the sake of
which she had skipped Sunday breakfast.
She had not forgotten how amazed and disappointed
Robbie had looked with the saucer in
one hand, the plate in the other, while the door
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
swung impatiently back to its place. But
then, the poem was sufficient excuse for that
discourtesy, Berta assured herself in anxiety
to justify her behavior. If she had waited to
be polite, the thought and the rhymes would
doubtless have scattered beyond recall. Nobody
could condemn her for slamming the
door and hurrying again to her desk. She
had saved the rondel, and it had been printed
in the Monthly. That was worth some sacrifice,
even of manners to dear old Robbie.
She always understood and forgave such small
transgressions of the laws of friendship. Only
it certainly looked different when somebody
else did it.
</p>
<p>An hour or so later while Berta was bending
devotedly over her notes in the history
alcove of the library, she was vaguely aware
of a newcomer sauntering carelessly behind
her chair. A heavy book clattered to the
floor, and somebody&#8217;s elbow in stooping to
pick it up nudged her arm. Her pen went
scratching in a mad zigzag across the neat
page and deposited a big tear of red ink where
it suddenly stopped.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; exclaimed Bea repentantly,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
for she was indeed the culprit; &#8220;it&#8217;s
horrid to be heedless on purpose. I didn&#8217;t
know it would really do any harm.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Berta glanced up quickly from her blotter.
So Bea considered a reckless disregard for
books and persons also a quality of genius.
Berta felt a slow blush creeping up to her
brow at the candid memory of her tendency
to bump into things and brush against people
when in a dreamy mood&mdash;and to pass on
without even a beg pardon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re evidently new to the business, my
cautious and calculating young friend,&#8221; she
whispered, &#8220;you should have ignored the
resultant calamity. Ah&mdash;why, child!&#8221; she
stared in surprise, &#8220;your collar is pinned
crooked and your turnover is flying loose at
one end, and your hair is coming down. You
look scandalous.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bea looked triumphant also. &#8220;It&#8217;s an
artistic disarray,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard
work because I&#8217;ve slipped into the habit of
being prim and precise, and I had to bend a
pin intentionally. Four girls already have
warned me about my hair falling down. It
worries me a lot and yet it doesn&#8217;t give the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
same effect as yours. Does yours feel loose
and straggly?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Berta&#8217;s hand flew to her head. &#8220;You sinner!
Mine is just as usual.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know it,&#8221; assented Bea innocently,
&#8220;it&#8217;s a negligee style. I&#8217;m being a geni&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go away!&#8221; Berta snatched up her bottle
of red ink. &#8220;Fly, villain, depart, withdraw,
retreat, abscond, decamp,&mdash;in short, go
away!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bea went, holding her neck stiffly on one
side to balance the sensation of unsteadiness
above her ears. Berta watched her with a
wavering expression that veered from wrathful
amusement to uneasy reflectiveness. Was
it really true that she dressed so untidily as
this little scamp made out? Perhaps she did
slight details once in a while, but though not
scrupulously dainty like Lila, still she tried
to be neat enough on the whole. Could it be
possible that the other girls criticised her so
severely as this?
</p>
<p>The suspicion bothered her so effectually
that she left the library five minutes early and
hurried to her room for a few renovating
touches before luncheon. Her hair caused
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
her such extraordinary pains that she was late
in reaching the table. She found that Bea
had usurped her place at the head, but forgot
to object in the confusion of being greeted
with: &#8220;Heigho, Berta, what&#8217;s happened?&#8221;
&#8220;You&#8217;re spick and span enough for a party.&#8221;
&#8220;Are you going to town this afternoon?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Young ladies!&#8221; Berta ignored the warm
color that she felt rising slowly under her
dark skin, &#8220;I am astonished at your manners.
Don&#8217;t you know that you should never refer
to an individual&#8217;s personal appearance? I
read that in a book on etiquette. You may
allude to my money, to my brains, to the
beauty of my soul, but you must not remark
upon my looks. I don&#8217;t understand the principle
of the thing, unless it is that compliments
on the other three articles fail to injure
the character, whereas flattery with regard to
my pulchritude&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bea&#8217;s hand shot into the air and waved
frantically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Please, teacher, what is that funny word?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go to the Latin lexicon, thou ignoramus.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t,&#8221; said Bea, &#8220;you borrowed mine
and never brought it back. It&#8217;s being a&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But aren&#8217;t you going anywhere?&#8221; asked
Robbie Belle who had been filling Berta&#8217;s
plate and pouring her milk during the discourse.
</p>
<p>Bea sent a bewitching smile straight into
Berta&#8217;s eyes. &#8220;I&#8217;m &#8217;most sure she is going to
give me a swimming lesson at half past four.
Then if it is still raining this evening, we
can all swim over to the chapel for the concert.
Please, Berta.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; acquiesced Berta carelessly.
&#8220;I will do it because I am so noble and you
are a literary person, though how in this
world of incomprehensibilities you managed
to get elected to that editorial board passes
my powers of apperception. Robbie, will
you be so kind as to reach me that saltcellar?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to say, &#8216;Salt!&#8217; at the beginning,
and then while you are putting in the
rest of the words, she can be handing it over,&#8221;
advised Bea; &#8220;ah, what was the thought I was
about to think?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She paused in dispensing the main dish and
rolled up her eyes vacantly for a moment before
she dropped the spoon without a glance
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
at the cloth to see if it left a stain and rising
walked dreamily out of the dining-room.
</p>
<p>The other girls stared. Robbie looked
alarmed till Gertrude caught the likeness and
explained: &#8220;It&#8217;s &#8216;sincerest flattery&#8217; for you,
Berta. Imitation, you understand. When
an idea strikes you, you drop everything
and wander away while Robbie or Bea picks
up the spoon and goes on ladling out the
stuff in the dish at your place. What a
monkey!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, a missionary,&#8221; corrected Berta, her
eyes and mouth contradicting each other as
usual. This time her eyes tried to hide a
troubled spark in their depths while her
mouth twitched over the joke of it all. &#8220;She
is posing as an awful example.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here I am again!&#8221; Bea appeared suddenly
in her seat. &#8220;I find I&#8217;m considerably
hungry still,&#8221; she vouchsafed in response to a
chorus of taunts and jeers. &#8220;Ideas aren&#8217;t
filling, so to speak. At least, mine aren&#8217;t&mdash;and
they most of them belong to other people;
hence I infer that other people&#8217;s aren&#8217;t
either. Is that plain, my dear young and
giddy friends? Now, somebody, applesauce!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
she called, and added politely, &#8220;please
pass it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Berta regarded her sternly. &#8220;Beatrice
Leigh, you are running this scheme pretty far
into the ground. When you reach bed-rock,
something is likely to get a bump. Take care!
Remember!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, yes, Berta. Half-past four at
the swimming-tank in the gymnasium. I&#8217;ll
be there. Trust me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Trust you!&#8221; echoed Berta in withering
scorn.
</p>
<p>Bea lifted a face bearing a suitably wounded
expression.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I trust you,&#8221; she murmured in touchingly
plaintive tones. &#8220;I shall be in the water at
the stroke of the half hour&mdash;in the icy water.
Promise that you will not fail me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right!&#8221; Berta dismissed the engagement
from her mind with a heedless assent.
An hour later while she was absorbed in looking
over the week&#8217;s daily themes which she
had found in the box, Robbie walked in rather
disconsolately.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bea&#8217;s writing a poem, too,&#8221; she said; &#8220;she
scowled at me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></p>
<p>Berta frowned in abstraction. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; she
muttered, &#8220;yes, yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Robbie looked at her and then stared
out at the steady pall of rain. &#8220;I think I
shall go swimming with you, if you want
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do come.&#8221; It was a mechanical response
while Berta&#8217;s eyes narrowed in the intensity
of her application. &#8220;Now I wonder what
that question-mark on the margin can mean.
She is the vaguest critic I ever had. Suggestive,
I reckon, and nothing else.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Robbie sighed. &#8220;Bea always used to be interested
in everything. I wish she wouldn&#8217;t
write poems. She walked right past four
girls and didn&#8217;t see them. They were astonished.
They asked me if she was sick or
anything. Her eyes were sort of rolled up in
her head, as if she were being oblivious on
purpose.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Um-m,&#8221; replied Berta brilliantly from the
depths of her own obliviousness, &#8220;quite
likely. Alas! there is another questionable
question-mark. I do wish she weren&#8217;t so
stingy with her red ink.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Robbie sighed again and looked at the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
clock. &#8220;It will be half past four in two
hours,&#8221; she volunteered.
</p>
<p>Berta pushed back her hair with an impatient
gesture. &#8220;Robbie Belle, the longer it
rains, the more loquacious you become. Do
go and write a note to Lila, or darn stockings
or something. I have a committee meeting at
three, and you bother me dreadfully, with
your chatter. Do run along, there&#8217;s a dear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Robbie rose and wandered away forlornly.
Even though she did not feel like studying,
she half wished that she had not finished the
preparation of Monday&#8217;s lessons. College on
a rainy Saturday afternoon, when all your
friends are writing poems, is not a very cheerful
place.
</p>
<p>At half-past four Berta was in the midst of
a fiery argument about the program for the
Junior Party to the seniors. The dispute concerned
some fine point of æsthetic taste in the
choice of paper and position of monogram.
The stroke of the half hour reminded her of
the engagement with Bea, but she lightly
pushed aside the thought as of no consequence
in comparison with the present emergency.
</p>
<p>It was ten minutes to five when she seized
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
an umbrella and scurried across the campus
to the gymnasium. There in the dusk of fading
light from the clouded sky outside she beheld
the swimming-tank deserted, its surface
still glinting in soft ripples as if from recent
plunging.
</p>
<p>At sound of a rustle in one of the dressing-rooms,
Berta called Bea&#8217;s name. It was Robbie&#8217;s
voice that answered her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bea&#8217;s gone out walking.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Out walking?&#8221; echoed Berta scandalized
and incredulous.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, she was here in the water at half-past
four, just as she had said she would be. She
waited for you, and tried to swim at the end
of a curtain pole. I held it steady for her,
but when she was the teacher, she let me duck
under. And we weren&#8217;t sure about the stroke
anyhow. And we kept getting colder and
colder.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; the voice sounded as if suddenly
enlightened. &#8220;At what time did you go in?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was after three, and she waited for you
till twenty minutes to five. Then she said
she thought it would be interesting to go up
to the orchard and gather apple-blossoms with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
rain-drops fresh on the petals. She said it
would be poetic and erratic and a lot of fun.
So she went. She said it would be more like
a real genius if she went alone, and so I
didn&#8217;t go with her. Besides that, she took
my umbrella, and it isn&#8217;t big enough for
two.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is queer that she did not wait longer,&#8221;
commented Berta wonderingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She said it would be more whimsical and
unexpected to stroll off in that eccentric way.
She explained how she is being made over,
Mother April, from the rag-bag of the world;
and so she has to be different.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope that she gets very wet indeed,&#8221;
said Berta, &#8220;and I don&#8217;t see why I should
worry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Robbie&#8217;s voice answered, &#8220;Bea worried
about you that day last fall when you went
off alone in that storm to find fringed gentians.
The branches were crashing down in
the wind, and one girl had seen a tramp out
on that lonely road. You said you could take
care of yourself, but we worried.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that was different,&#8221; exclaimed Berta.
&#8220;I am perfectly capable of judging for myself.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
But Bea is such a scatterbrain that I
can&#8217;t help feeling&#8221;&mdash;she hesitated, then
added as if to herself, &#8220;There isn&#8217;t any
sense in feeling responsible. She is old
enough&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t hear when you mumble,&#8221; called
Robbie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bea is an awful idiot,&#8221; replied Berta in a
louder key. &#8220;Did you catch that valuable
bit of information, Robbie Belle?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It sounds,&#8221; spoke Robbie with unexpected
astuteness, &#8220;as if you are really worrying
after all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Does it?&#8221; groaned Berta; &#8220;well, then I
am an idiot too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She sternly refused to look anxious even
when the dressing-gong found the wanderer
still absent in the rain. At six Berta started
for the dining-room, leaving Robbie hovering
at Bea&#8217;s open door with a supply of hot
water, rough towels, dry stockings, and spirits
of camphor. In the leaden twilight of the
lower corridor a draggled figure passed with a
sodden drip of heavy skirts and the dull
squashing of water in soaked shoes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are the apple-blossoms?&#8221; asked
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
Berta in polite greeting as they met at the
elevator.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve b-b-b-been studying b-b-b-bobolinks,&#8221;
Bea&#8217;s teeth chattered. &#8220;It&#8217;s original to follow
birds in the rain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But&#8221;&mdash;Berta&#8217;s eyes snapped, &#8220;I myself
when I did it I wore a gym suit and a mackintosh
and rubber boots. Of all the idiots!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;O wad some power the giftie gie us,&#8217;&#8221;
chanted Bea&#8217;s tongue between clicks,
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;&#8216;To see oursels as ithers see us,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>It wad fra mony a blunder free us,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>And foolish notion.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Then as Berta took a threatening step in
her direction, she broke into a run. &#8220;I think
I&#8217;ll take some exercise now,&#8221; she called back
mockingly as she fled up the stairs.
</p>
<p>At midnight Berta was roused wide awake
by an insistent rapping on the wall between
her room and Bea&#8217;s. Startled at last wide
awake, she asked what was the trouble. Upon
receiving no audible reply, she hurried around
through the corridor to the door. She heard
the key turned as she grasped the knob. An
instant later she felt Bea sway against her and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
stand choking for breath, her hands to her
chest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s croup,&#8221; she gasped. &#8220;The doctor!
Run!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Berta ran. She ran as she had never run
before. Down the endless corridor and up
the stairs, two steps at a time. Then a hail
of frantic knocks on the doctor&#8217;s door brought
her rushing to answer. In four minutes they
were back beside Bea&#8217;s bed, and the doctor&#8217;s
orders kept Berta flying, till after a limitless
space of horror and struggle she heard dimly
from the distance: &#8220;She&#8217;ll do now.&#8221;
Whereupon Berta sat down quietly in a chair
and fainted.
</p>
<p>The next day was Sunday. Berta carried
Bea her breakfast.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-morning, Beatrice,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
decided that I am tired of being a genius.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So am I,&#8221; said Bea.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No more poems!&#8221; cried Robbie Belle and
clapped her hands. &#8220;Oh, goodie!&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>A WAVE OF REFORM</h3>
</div>

<p>Bea did her hair high for the first time in
public on the evening of the Philalethean
Reception in her sophomore year. As was to
have been expected, this event of vital importance
demanded such careful preparation
that she missed the address in chapel altogether
and was late for the first dance.
When at last she really put in an appearance&mdash;and
a radiant appearance it was, with cheeks
flushed from the ardor of her artistic labors,
she found the revelry in full swing, so to
speak. The corridors and drawing-rooms
were thronged with fair daughters and brave
sons. Naturally the daughters were in the
majority, most of them fair with the beauty
of youth. The sons were necessarily brave to
face the cohorts of critical eyes that watched
them from all sides.
</p>
<p>Two of the critical eyes belonged to Bea as
she stood on the stairs for a few minutes and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
mourned that her handsomest cousin was not
there to admire her new white crêpe, and also
to be admired of the myriad guestless girls.
She caught a glimpse of Lila in rose-colored
mull as she promenaded past with a cadet all
to herself. Berta and Robbie were walking
together in the ceaseless procession from end
to end of the second floor corridor, while the
orchestra played and the couples whirled in
the big dining-room. They were talking just
as earnestly as if they had not seen each other
every day for a year. Bea&#8217;s dimple twinkled
and she took a step forward under the impulse
to join them for the fun of chaffing them about
such polite devotion.
</p>
<p>At that moment Gertrude touched her
shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Beatrice Leigh, have you anybody
engaged for this number and the next? My
brother has turned up unexpectedly, and I
haven&#8217;t a single partner for him. Won&#8217;t you
take care of him while I rush around to fill
his program? Do! There&#8217;s a dear!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Bea, &#8220;can he talk?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;N-no, not much, but you can, and he&#8217;s
awfully easy to entertain. Tell him about
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
the girls or college life or anything. He&#8217;s
interested in it all. Will you? Oh, please!
There goes Sara now. I&#8217;ve got to catch her
first thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bring on the brother,&#8221; exclaimed Bea
magnanimously, &#8220;I&#8217;ll talk to him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And she did. Twenty minutes later, when
Gertrude in her frantic search through the
shifting crowds explored the farthest group
of easy chairs in senior corridor, she discovered
Miss Bea still chattering vivaciously to a rapt
audience of one.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been telling him about our playing
at politics last month,&#8221; she paused to explain;
&#8220;he was interested.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The brother smiled down at her. &#8220;It is
certainly a most entertaining story,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Things generally are when Bea tells
them,&#8221; commented Gertrude, &#8220;that is one of
her gifts.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you!&#8221; Bea swept her a curtsey.
&#8220;But don&#8217;t hurry. Didn&#8217;t you know
that I promised him a dance as a reward for
listening to my dissertation on reform. Some
day I&#8217;ll maybe tell you the story.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This is the story:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></p>
<p>Did Gertrude ever tell you about our playing
at politics when we were sophomores?
Possibly you have heard politics defined as
present history, and history as past politics.
On that understanding, this tale is a history.
It is the history of a great reform. When I sit
down to reflect, a luxury for which I seldom
have time even in vacation, it really seems to
me that I have been reforming all my life.
Lila has reformed a good deal since she
entered college, and Berta has been almost as
bad as I. Robbie Belle is the best one among
us, but she does not realize it. That is the
reason why she is such a dear. She never
preaches&mdash;that is, never unless it is her plain
duty as at that time in the north tower, when
we were freshmen, you remember. If she
disapproves of any of our schemes, she simply
says she doesn&#8217;t want to do it. That was what
she said when the rest of us proposed to
masquerade as a gang of wardheelers on election
day.
</p>
<p>You know what wardheelers are, I suppose.
They are politicians who hang around the
polls and watch the voting and see that people
vote for the right party, or the wrong party,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
for the matter of that. It all depends on
which side they belong. When they notice
anybody going to vote for the other side, they
sort of intimidate him, tell him to get away,
or else push him out of line or punch him in
the head or something like that. Sometimes
they stuff the ballot-boxes, too, or go from one
poll to another, voting over and over.
</p>
<p>Now Robbie Belle had joined in with all
the other fun that autumn. There were imitation
rallies and parades and receptions to
candidates and mock banquets with real
speeches and fudges and crackers to eat. She
made a perfectly splendid presidential candidate
at one of the meetings. She looked ever
so much like him too as she sat gravely on
the platform with her hair parted on one side,
and a borrowed silk hat clasped to the bosom
of her brother&#8217;s dress suit. When all at once
her face crinkled in a sudden irresistible
smile, even the seniors said she was dear.
But this time she said she&#8217;d rather not be a
wardheeler. She wouldn&#8217;t come to a banquet
of the gang the night before election day
either. She said she guessed she didn&#8217;t want
to.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></p>
<p>Berta and Lila and I collected butter and
sugar and milk at the dinner table that evening.
In our dormitory we are allowed to carry
away bread and milk to our rooms, but we are
not supposed to take sugar or butter for fudges.
That seemed awfully stingy to us then; for in
the pantry there were barrels of sugar, great
cans of milk, hundreds and thousands of little
yellow butterballs piled on big platters.
We thought it wouldn&#8217;t do any harm to use a
tiny bit of it all for our banquet.
</p>
<p>At dinner I slid two butterballs into my
glass of milk, and Lila filled her glass with
sugar from the bowl and then poured enough
milk over it to hide the grainy look. Robbie
Belle kept her eyes in another direction, but
Berta said we had a right to one of the balls
anyhow, because she had not eaten butter all
day. Berta is the brightest girl in the class
and she can argue about everything, and let
the other person choose her side of the question
first too. It was not until later that she
reformed from that tendency to juggle with
her intellect, as Prexie calls it.
</p>
<p>Well, Lila and I marched down the long
dining-room, past the seniors and the faculty
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
table, with our glasses held up in plain sight.
As soon as we reached the corridor in unmolested
safety, Lila gave a skip so joyous that
some drops spattered on the floor.
</p>
<p>She said, &#8220;Nobody caught us that time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; I jogged her elbow so that unluckily
more milk splashed on the rubber
matting, &#8220;there&#8217;s Martha.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Martha, you know&mdash;or probably you don&#8217;t
know until I tell you&mdash;was a freshman who
roomed with Lila and me that year. She was
the dearest little conscientious child with big
eyes that were always staring at us solemnly
and giving me the shivers. She appeared to
think so much more than she spoke that we
respected her a lot and tried to set her a good
example.
</p>
<p>Martha was waiting for the elevator. She
turned around and gazed at us without saying
a word. She is considerably like Robbie
Belle in her exasperating power of silence, but
neither of them does it on purpose.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately just then a senior behind her
turned around too and said, &#8220;Nobody catches
anybody here. This is a college, not a boarding
school.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></p>
<p>Now such a remark as that was distinctly
unkind, not so much because either Lila or I
had ever been to a boarding school, for we
hadn&#8217;t, as because we wished we had. We
had devoured all the stories about them and
envied the girls in them. We had hoped that
we would find some of the same kind of fun
at college itself.
</p>
<p>Lila blushed, and I could not think of any
repartee that would be appropriate, especially
as Martha was staring so hard at the glass of
sugar. I had noticed all the fall that she was
an odd child about candy. She never would
touch a mouthful of any that we made&mdash;and
we made it pretty often&mdash;maybe four times a
week. She always just shook her head and
said she&#8217;d rather not.
</p>
<p>It was a relief to hear the elevator come rattling
up from the first floor. The dining-room
is on the second, you see, though I don&#8217;t
know that this fact has any bearing on the
story; still it may supply local color or realism
or something like that. Well, we entered
the elevator, and there stood a junior in the
corner. This junior chanced to be an editor
of the college magazine which had offered a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
ten dollar prize for the best short story handed
in before October twentieth. She glanced at
us and then stared hard at Martha till we had
passed the third floor, and at the fourth she
walked out behind us and spoke to Martha.
She said, &#8220;Miss Reed, I think I am not premature
in congratulating you upon the story
which you submitted in the contest. You
will receive official notice of your victory before
very long.&#8221; And then she smiled the
nicest sweetest smile at sight of Martha&#8217;s face.
It was like a burst of sunshine&mdash;anybody
would have smiled. I hugged her&mdash;Martha,
not the junior, because I am not well acquainted
with her, you understand&mdash;but I
wanted to hug everybody. Lila squeezed
Martha so hard that she squeaked out loud.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; sighed the little freshman almost to
herself, &#8220;now I can send mother a birthday
present.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wasn&#8217;t that dear of her to think of giving
it away first thing! Of course some girls
would have thought of having a spread to
celebrate and invite in all the crowd; but
Martha was only a freshman and probably
had no college spirit as yet. Her remark
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
seemed to remind Lila of something, for she
quite jumped and exclaimed, &#8220;Why, you baby,
I had forgotten all about that two dollars and
seventy-five cents I borrowed of you last
month. And here it is only the sixth of
November, but my allowance is nearly gone.
Why didn&#8217;t you poke up my memory?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I owe her ninety cents,&#8221; said I.
</p>
<p>The little freshman walked on with her
hands clasped high up over her necktie.
&#8220;Will they give me the prize soon?&#8221; she
asked softly, &#8220;because the birthday is Thursday,
and to-day is Monday, and it takes two
days to get there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lila looked at me and I looked at Lila.
&#8220;We can scrape it together somehow,&#8221; she
said. Then she touched Martha on the
shoulder. &#8220;Do you want to buy it to-morrow?&#8221;
she inquired, &#8220;because if you do, you
shall. We&#8217;ll manage it somehow. We&#8217;ll pay
you what we owe, and then you can buy a
present even if the prize doesn&#8217;t arrive in
time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you!&#8221; It was strange to see
how voluble happiness was making the child.
&#8220;Will you really? I&#8217;ve wanted and wanted,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
but I couldn&#8217;t ask. I&#8217;ve got an engagement
down town to try on my gymnasium suit to-morrow
afternoon and I shall be so glad. I
can mail it then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said I, &#8220;we&#8217;ll get it for you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then we forgot all about it till noon the
next day. That was election day and full of
excitement, even if we hadn&#8217;t been late to
breakfast, because the fudges kept us awake
the night before. Martha had gone into her
room early to study. Though she had closed
the door I am afraid the girls made a lot of
noise; and she woke up with a headache. Of
course Berta and I and the others had a right
to cut late if we wanted to do so, but we didn&#8217;t
mean to keep anybody from working.
</p>
<p>Martha returned from breakfast just as I
was catching together a tiny hole in my
stocking above the shoe. It wasn&#8217;t really my
stocking, for I had lost mine by sending them
unmarked to the laundry, and so I had borrowed
these from Martha. They were her
finest best ones, I believe, and very nice,
though her clothes generally seemed shabby.
This morning she told us to hurry down
please, because the maid was feeling miserable.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
We did hurry and tried not to complain of
the cold cocoa or the tough steak, though it is
certainly the maid&#8217;s duty to get fresh hot
things no matter how late the girls are. She
couldn&#8217;t find our favorite crescent rolls in the
pantry or down-stairs in the bakery or anywhere.
Before we were through eating, the
other maids had cleared away their breakfast
dishes and had their tables all set for luncheon.
Our maid was naturally slow, I suspect.
</p>
<p>After breakfast we had barely time to
smooth the counterpanes over sheets and
blankets that lay in wrinkles. They looked
pretty well on top, but honestly I was relieved
to have Martha and her big eyes out of
the way. Though we snatched our books and
ran through the corridors we were two
minutes tardy in reaching the Latin room.
The instructor was so irritable that she laid
down her book and the whole class waited
while Lila and I tiptoed to our seats in the
middle of the last row.
</p>
<p>With all the campaign excitement of course
we had let our work get crowded out, and the
other girls appeared to be in the same fix.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
When the most dazzling star in the class
flunked on a grammatical reference, the instructor
bit her lip and sent the question flying
up one row and down another as fast as
the students could shake their heads. As it
came leaping nearer and nearer to us, Lila
remembered a college story about a girl sliding
from her place and kneeling behind the
seat in front till the question had passed on
over the vacant spot. Lila was so agitated
that she forgot how conspicuous we had been
in entering late. She slipped out of her seat
and hid like the girl in the story. Then fell
an awful stillness. The question stopped
right there, hovering over the empty place.
Everybody waited. The instructor set her
mouth in grimmer lines, and waited, her eyes
glued to the spot from where Lila had
vanished. Those in front turned around to
look. Lila knelt there waiting and waiting
for the question to be passed on to me. I
shook my head as vigorously as I dared, but
nobody paid any attention. Lila waited and
waited; the instructor waited; everybody
waited and waited, till Lila&#8217;s knees ached so
that she lifted her face and peeked. She
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
peeked straight into those grim waiting eyes
on the platform.
</p>
<p>Then the instructor said, &#8220;Miss Allan?&#8221;
with the usual dreadful interrogative inflection,
and Lila shook her head. She slid
back into her seat with her cheeks as red as
fire.
</p>
<p>The minute we escaped into the hall at the
end of the recitation, the girls gathered around
us and giggled and teased Lila till she almost
broke down and cried before them all. There
is a lot of difference between playing jokes on
another person and appearing ridiculous yourself.
The first few weeks of the year we had
teased Martha by telling her it was etiquette
for freshmen to rise when addressed by sophomores
and stuff like that. The little thing
was so unsophisticated that we made up yards
and yards of stories about the dangers of going
walking alone or being out after dusk. One
student really did have her purse snatched
last year, and a senior saw a masked robber
in the pines, and once a maid caught a glimpse
of a face outside her window, and actually one
evening six of us beheld with our own eyes a
man jump through the hedge.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></p>
<p>On this particular morning I had no time
to waste, for my tutor in mathematics had
warned me that she intended to charge me
for the hour for which I had engaged her, no
matter whether I arrived on the scene or not.
That struck me as queer and rather mean, because
on some days I did not feel like going,
and I failed to see why I should pay her for
tutoring that I had not received. She said
that her time was valuable and an hour
squandered in waiting for a delinquent pupil
was so much loss. I guess it was a loss to me
too.
</p>
<p>While I was flying around, trying to find
my notes and pen, I heard a gulp and a sob
from Martha&#8217;s bedroom, and popped in to find
her with her head buried in the pillow. The
little idiot was crying because she had flunked
in English.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but English is so easy to bluff in!&#8221;
I exclaimed, &#8220;almost any string of words will
do if the teacher asks for a discussion of a
tendency or of nature or vocabulary or poetic
form or something. Didn&#8217;t you make a try
at some sort of an answer?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I said I didn&#8217;t know,&#8221; sobbed Martha,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
&#8220;and I didn&#8217;t. My thoughts were all mixed
up and I couldn&#8217;t remember a line.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You goosie!&#8221; I was disgusted. &#8220;If I
said I didn&#8217;t know at every opportunity where
I could say it truthfully, how long do you
think I would be allowed to stay in this institution
of learning? When I don&#8217;t know a
fact, I use fancy. It is the greatest fun to
catch a hint and elaborate it into a brilliant
recitation without a jot of knowledge to back
it up. It takes brains to do it. You&#8217;ve got
to learn to bluff, and then get along without
studying.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The little freshman raised her heavy eyes,
all reddened about the lids. &#8220;Oh, but that
isn&#8217;t honest,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not honest?&#8221; For an instant I was actually
alarmed. Once when I myself was a
freshman I nearly lost my faith in human
nature because a senior whom I admired did
something that looked dishonest. But sending
valentines to yourself in order to win a
prize is different from bluffing. So I said,
&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; and was just hurrying out of
the door when she called in a quivery voice:
&#8220;P-please, may I borrow a sheet of theme
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
paper? Mine&#8217;s all gone and I can&#8217;t buy&mdash;I
mean, it&#8217;s due to-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Help yourself,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;there&#8217;s a
heap of it that I carried away from the last German
test. Right hand drawer of the desk.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no! I can&#8217;t take that. Haven&#8217;t you
any that you bought with your own money?
I&#8217;ll pay it back. That paper&mdash;they gave it to
you&mdash;didn&#8217;t they give it to you just for the
test?&#8221;
</p>
<p>I stopped and walked over to feel of her
head and tell her that she ought to see the
doctor or take a nap or something. Then I
gave her three sheets of the paper and told
her not to be silly. I don&#8217;t know whether she
used it or not. At luncheon she appeared
with her fingers inky and her hat on.
</p>
<p>Berta said, &#8220;Whither, my child?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She answered, &#8220;Down town.&#8221; And then
she looked at Lila with such anxious eyes that
I jumped and clapped my hands together in
contrition.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lila, we&#8217;ve forgotten to get that money
for her!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Martha turned her face toward me and sat
gazing like a little dog. We asked all the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
girls at the table for contributions, but they
were nearly penniless. I said, &#8220;Are you in a
hurry, Martha?&#8221; And she said she had to
be there at two o&#8217;clock. So we told her to
hurry on, and we would get the money somewhere
and meet her on the corner of Main
and Market Streets at quarter past four sharp.
She said, &#8220;Honest?&#8221; And I answered, &#8220;Yes,
trust me. We&#8217;ll be there, and I&#8217;ll stand treat
for soda water, if I can scrape up any extra
pennies. You run along and pick out your
present.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And then, do you know, in spite of all that
and our promise to meet her, we forgot every
bit about it till half-past four! You see, it
was election day, and we were frightfully
busy. After the fifth hour recitation we
hurried into the ragged blue overalls that we
had worn in one of the torchlight parades.
Lila punched up the crown of an old felt alpine
hat, and I battered my last summer&#8217;s
sailor till it looked disreputable enough.
Then we rushed over to the gymnasium to
join our gang of wardheelers.
</p>
<p>We found the judges sitting at bare tables
with their lists before them and wooden booths
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
along the walls. And then&mdash;oh, I can&#8217;t do
justice to the fun we had! Some of us hung
around outside and tried to scare away opposing
voters by telling how the judges might
make them sing scales or slide down ropes or
wipe off their smiles on the carpets or chant
the laundry list or write their names in ink
with their noses, if they should be challenged.
We actually succeeded in frightening away
several timid freshmen. The rest of the gang
pretended to stuff ballot-boxes and buy votes,
just as we had read in the papers.
</p>
<p>Berta, Lila and I voted while wearing our
overalls. Then we dashed back to our rooms
and dressed in our ordinary clothes and attempted
to vote a second time. Such fun!
The judges recognized us and refused to accept
our ballots. Such an uproar as we
raised! The other wardheelers stormed to
the rescue; the lists were scattered, and the
tables overturned. Of course it was only a
joke, and most of us were too weak from
laughing to clear away the disorder in time
for the polls to close promptly.
</p>
<p>And then we happened to remember
Martha.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></p>
<p>There it was half-past four and it would
certainly be five before we could get ready and
catch the car and reach the corner of Main
and Market. So we let it go and decided that
she would be tired of waiting by that time
and start for home, and we might most likely
miss her anyhow, even if we should collect
the money and try to keep the engagement.
And besides that we were having such a picnic
telling about the turmoil at the polls that we
hated to waste a minute away from the scene.
Berta had a splendid idea about dressing up
as policemen and borrowing the express wagon
belonging to the janitor&#8217;s grandson, and then
tearing over to the gym as if we had been
summoned to arrest the hoodlums and take
them to jail in the patrol. It was so late,
however, that we had to give this plan up and
get ready for dinner. It was a dreadful disappointment.
</p>
<p>Martha hadn&#8217;t come yet. It was half-past
five and dark, and then it was quarter of six,
and then it was six, and we went down to
dinner, but she hadn&#8217;t come yet. And then
it was half-past six, and we went down the
avenue to the Lodge to watch the car unload,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
but no Martha. We danced in parlor J for a
while, and then we went to chapel at seven,
but she hadn&#8217;t come yet. And then we
walked down to the Lodge again and watched
three cars stop and turn around the curve,
one after another, but she wasn&#8217;t in any of
them. And then we went back to tell Mrs.
Howard, the lady principal, about it. And
she was awfully anxious and asked all sorts of
questions about Martha, and what kind of a
girl she was, and if she had any money with
her, or any friends in town, or any peculiar
habits about running away from her friends,
or any trouble lately or anything.
</p>
<p>Then she began to telephone and went to
see Prexie, and Lila and I wandered out to
the stairs above the bulletin board where the
students were waiting to hear the election returns.
Between the successive telegrams the
girls clapped and laughed and stamped and
hissed at speeches by the seniors and juniors,
or else they sang patriotic songs.
</p>
<p>When Miss Benton, president of the
Students&#8217; Association, the greatest honor in
the college course, and she is the finest senior
in the class too&mdash;was urged upon a chair to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
make a speech, Lila almost pushed me through
the banisters in her excitement. She has admired
Miss Benton ever since the first day
when it rained, and we were so terribly homesick,
and she smiled at us in the corridor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; whispered Lila, &#8220;listen! Isn&#8217;t
she beautiful!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ouch!&#8221; said I, &#8220;she isn&#8217;t beautiful, she&#8217;s
downright plain with her hair smoothed back
that way.&#8221; But I said it pretty low, because
that staircase banked with girls was no place
for distinctly enunciated personalities. It was
a humorous speech, for one reason of Miss
Benton&#8217;s popularity is her fun under a dignified
manner. In the middle of the cheering
after she had finished, the messenger girl appeared
with a new bulletin. Somebody read
it aloud so that we could all hear. It reported
the victory of the corrupt party machine in an
important city. Nobody spoke. There was
just the faint sound of a big sighing oh-h-h!
and then a hush.
</p>
<p>The next thing I knew, Miss Benton and
some other seniors were coming up the stairs,
and the girls were moving this way and that
to open a path for them. Lila crowded closer
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
to me so as to make way. A junior on the
step below reached up her hand and stopped
Miss Benton as she was passing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do wait for the next telegram, Mary,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;perhaps that will be more encouraging.
The country as a whole seems to be going
right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Benton dropped down beside her with
an awfully discouraged sort of a sigh. &#8220;You
don&#8217;t live there, and I do,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You
do not know how the reform party has
worked with soul and strength to defeat that
boss. Something is terribly wrong with the
citizens and their standards of honesty. How
could they? How could they?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The junior bent nearer to speak in lower
tones; but Lila and I could not help hearing.
&#8220;Mary, something is wrong with us too,&#8221; she
whispered. &#8220;Did you know that to-day at
our mock election some of the sophomores
pretended to be corrupt voters and wardheelers?
They intimidated voters, challenged
registrations, played at buying votes, tried to
stuff the ballot-boxes. There was a most disgraceful
scrimmage! To turn such crimes into
a joke! How could they? How could we?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></p>
<p>Miss Benton straightened herself with a
movement that was sorrowful and angry and
discouraged all at once. She drew a deep
breath.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will tell you what is wrong with us as
well as with the entire country. Our ideal of
honesty is wrong. With us here at college
the trouble is in little things; with the world
of business and politics the evil is in great
matters too. But the principle is the same.
We are not honest. We condemn graft in
public office. Is it not also graft when a
student helps herself to examination foolscap
and takes it for private use? Is the girl who
carries away sugar from the table any better
than the government employee who misappropriates
funds or supplies in his charge?
We cry out in horror at revelations of bribery.
Ah, but in our class elections do we vote for
the candidate who will best fill the office, or
for our friends? I have known a girl who
desired to be president of the Athletic Association
to bargain away her influence to another
who was running for an editorship.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And some of us travel on passes which
are made out in other names.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></p>
<p>Miss Benton did not hear. &#8220;We exclaim&mdash;we
point our fingers&mdash;we groan over the
trickery of officials, scandals, bribery, treachery,
lawlessness. And yet we&mdash;is it honest to
bluff in recitations&mdash;to lay claim to knowledge
which we do not possess? Is it honest
to injure a library book and not pay for the
damage? Is it honest to neglect to return
borrowed property? Some of us rob the
maids of strength by obliging them to work
overtime in waiting on us at the table. Our
lack of punctuality steals valuable time from
tutors and teachers and each other. We cheat
the faculty by slighting our opportunities and
thus making their life work of inferior quality
to that which they have a right to expect.
By heedless exaggeration we may murder a
reputation&mdash;mutilate an existence. We
wrong each other by being less than our best.
We are unscrupulous about breaking promises.
Down town this afternoon at the corner of
Main and Market Streets I saw a freshman
waiting in the cold. She was walking to and
fro to get warm. Her teeth chattered,&mdash;she
was crying from nervous suspense. When I
spoke to her and advised her to return to college
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
before dark, she shook her head, and
said no, somebody had promised to meet her,
and she had to stay. Now that girl, whoever
it was, who broke that engagement, is responsible&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>I leaned forward and clutched Miss Benton&#8217;s
shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She hasn&#8217;t come back yet,&#8221; I cried; &#8220;do
you think she is there still? I forgot&mdash;I
thought it didn&#8217;t matter. I didn&#8217;t mean to&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Benton turned around her head to
look up at me, and the others near us looked
too, and down at the foot of the stairs the
crowd packed in front of the bulletin board
sort of quieted for a minute and seemed to be
listening and watching us. And up on the
wall over their heads the big clock went tick-tock,
tick-tock, tick-tock, and its long pendulum
swung to and fro.
</p>
<p>Then swish, swish, swish, the lady principal
came hurrying through the reception hall
beyond, with her silk skirts rustling, and her
face quite pale. And the girls turned their
heads toward her. She raised her hand and
said in her soft voice: &#8220;Are Miss Martha
Reed&#8217;s roommates here?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></p>
<p>And then some more girls with their hats
and coats on came running up the steps from
the vestibule. The crowd was buzzing like
everything when Lila and I pushed our way
through to tell Mrs. Howard we were there.
We caught scraps of sentences flying hither
and thither.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Run over?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lying in the road&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who found her?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, right there in the loneliest part.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Such a timid little thing&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Frightened and fell maybe&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Queer she didn&#8217;t take the car.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is she dead?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lila pushed ahead, thrusting the girls right
and left from her path. I couldn&#8217;t see her
face, but her shoulders kept pumping up and
down as if she were smothering. You know
she&#8217;s more sensitive than I am, and I felt
badly enough.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Howard took her hand and said,
&#8220;Miss Reed wishes to see you both and leave
a message.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Of course such a speech would make anybody
think she was dying. I rubbed my
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
sleeve across my eyes and shut my teeth together
and swallowed once, for the other girls
around were gazing after us. Lila walked on
with her head up. I couldn&#8217;t see anything
but the line of her cheek, and that looked
sort of cold and stony. We followed on over
the thick rugs into the second reception room.
There sitting in a big chair, leaning back
against a cushion kind of limp and pale but
not dead at all&mdash;there was Martha.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you get the money?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>Lila didn&#8217;t answer. She just dropped on
her knees and hid her face against Martha&#8217;s
dress.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a centerpiece I thought Mother
would like. I chose it in the shop-window
there at the corner while I was waiting.
Maybe it will get there almost in time if it is
mailed to-morrow, but the doctor says I must
go to the infirmary for a day or two. If you
would please send it away for me in the
morning&mdash;if you have the money to buy it,
Lila,&mdash;I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The doctor walked in alert and brusque as
usual but gentle too.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now for my captive,&#8221; she said, &#8220;time&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
up. Life in a study with two sophomores is
hard on a freshman&#8217;s nerves. A few days of
the rest-cure will about suit you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Martha glanced at me, for Lila was still
hiding her face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was silly of me,&#8221; she explained shyly,
&#8220;but I grew so nervous when you didn&#8217;t meet
me that I cried and that made it worse. I
watched every car and both sides of the street,
and I waited till after dark. You see, I
didn&#8217;t have any money for car-fare. After
they began to light the lamps, I started to
walk out here to the college. Everybody was
eating supper, and I was all alone on the road
with dark fields on both sides. I could not
help thinking of those dreadful robbers and
maniacs and tramps&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; cried the doctor.
</p>
<p>I drew a deep breath. &#8220;We told her,&#8221; I
said. &#8220;I&mdash;I&#8217;m afraid we exaggerated. I&mdash;I
thought it would be more interesting.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said the doctor. It was such a grim
sort of an oh that I repented some more,
though indeed it was not necessary.
</p>
<p>Martha smiled at me. I always did consider
her the dearest, most sympathetic little
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
thing. &#8220;It was my fault,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I am
such a coward anyhow. And then when I
ran past a rock, I imagined I saw something
move and jump toward me. I lost my wits
and ran and ran and ran till I twisted my
ankle and fell. I must have struck my head
on a stone. I&#8217;m sorry. It was silly of me to
run. Please don&#8217;t worry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That will do for the present,&#8221; said the
doctor.
</p>
<p>Then they carried her over to the infirmary.
Lila and I walked out past the
crowd in front of the bulletin board. They
were cheering.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen, Lila,&#8221; I said, &#8220;good news from
somewhere.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We promised to meet her,&#8221; said Lila.
</p>
<p>I hate regrets. &#8220;Well,&#8221; I said, &#8220;that&#8217;s all
over and done with. There is no use in bothering
about it now. But the next promise
we make&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Berta rushed up to us. &#8220;Oh, girls!&#8221; she
exclaimed, &#8220;did you catch that last return?
Reform is sweeping the country. Hurrah!&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>FOUR SOPHOMORES AND A DOG</h3>
</div>

<p>The last recitation of the winter term was
over, and the corridors were alive with girls
hurrying this way and that, pinning on their
hats, buttoning jackets, crowding into the elevator,
unfurling umbrellas, and chattering all
the time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hope you&#8217;ll have the nicest sort of a
time!&#8221; &#8220;Don&#8217;t stay up too late!&#8221; &#8220;Good-bye!&#8221;
&#8220;Oh, good-bye!&#8221; &#8220;Be sure to get
well rested this vacation!&#8221; &#8220;Awfully,
awfully sorry you wouldn&#8217;t come home with
me, Gertrude, you bad child! But I know
you won&#8217;t suffer from monotony with Berta
and Beatrice in the same study.&#8221; &#8220;Hurry,
girls, there&#8217;s the car now. Just hear that bell
jingle, will you!&#8221; &#8220;Good-bye, Gertrude,
and don&#8217;t let Sara work too hard!&#8221; &#8220;Oh,
good-bye!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gertrude felt the clutch of arms relax from
about her neck, and managed to breathe
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
again. This was one of the penalties&mdash;pleasant
enough, doubtless, if a person were
in the mood for it&mdash;of being a popular sophomore.
For a minute she lingered wearily in
the vestibule to watch the figures flying down
the avenue to the Lodge gates. How their
skirts fluttered and twisted around them, and
how their hats danced! Their suit-cases
bounded and bumped as they ran, and their
umbrellas churned up and down in choppy
billows before the boisterous March wind.
There! the last one had vanished in a whirl
of flapping ends and lively angles beyond the
dripping evergreens.
</p>
<p>As she was turning languidly away, a backward
glance espied two girls emerging from
one of the dormitories far across the flooded
lawn. They came skipping over the narrow
planks that had been laid in the rivers flowing
along the curving walks. The first was
Berta swathed in a hooded waterproof; and the
second, of course, was Beatrice, a tam flung
askew on her red curls, her arms thrust
through a coat sleeve or two, a laundry bag
swinging from one elbow, and a tin fudge pan
clasped tenderly and firmly beneath the other,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
while with the hands so providentially left
free she stooped at every third step to rescue one
or the other of her easy-fitting rubbers from
setting out on a watery voyage all by itself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi!&#8221; she gasped after a final shuffling
dash, as she caught sight of immaculate Gertrude,
&#8220;I wore your overshoes. Hope you
don&#8217;t mind. They&#8217;re not very wet inside, and
I brought over your things so that we can
move into our borrowed study right off now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are my things?&#8221; asked Gertrude
with natural curiosity and perhaps unnatural
calm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; jerking the laundry bag, &#8220;it holds
a lot&mdash;brushes, soap, nightgown, toothpowder,
fountain-pen, note-book, everything. Berta
carried your mending basket. You needn&#8217;t
bother one bit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll run back and forth for anything you
want,&#8221; volunteered Berta hastily at sight of an
irritable frown on the usually serene brow of
handsome Gertrude.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re cross!&#8221; commented Bea with a
cheerful vivacity that was exasperating to the
highest degree, considering that everybody
ought to be worn down to an unobtrusive
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
state of limp inertia after the three busy
months just concluded, &#8220;you&#8217;ve been cross
ever since Sara&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Berta, lend me your gossamer and rubbers,
please,&#8221; when Gertrude was unreasonably
provoked she had a habit of snapping out
her words even more clear-cut than usual.
An instant later she swept forth into the rain
only to stop short and hurry in again before
the door had swung shut. &#8220;We might as
well look at the study first,&#8221; she said in a
more gracious tone, &#8220;and we can draw lots to
see who is to have the inside bedroom. I
dare say the change to this building will be a
rest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Berta took quick survey from the window
to explore the cause for this amazing wavering
of purpose.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; she murmured in swift enlightenment,
&#8220;it&#8217;s Sara. She&#8217;s coming over the
path.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A peculiar expression flitted across Bea&#8217;s
ingenuous face&mdash;an expression half quizzical,
half sorry. &#8220;Then we&#8217;d better follow Gertrude&#8217;s
example, and clear the track. She&#8217;ll
cut us dead again&mdash;that meek little mouse of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
a girl! And I don&#8217;t blame her for it either,
so there!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Berta tucked a pensive skip in between
steps as they moved through the gloomy corridor
past rain-beaten windows. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t
like Gertrude to burst out like that just because
Sara came late to our domestic evening,
but it did spoil the fudges and the game and
everything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And not to give her a chance to explain!&#8221;
fumed Bea&#8217;s temper always ready to
flame over any injustice. &#8220;Before she could
open her lips, Gertrude blazed up, cold as an
icicle&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; interpolated demure Berta with
her most deeply shocked accent, &#8220;an icicle
blaze?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, hush, you&#8217;re the most disagreeable
person! I wish Lila hadn&#8217;t gone home.
Well, she did just that. She said the artistic
temperament was no excuse for discourteous
falsehood&mdash;or she almost the same as said it&mdash;meaning
breaking your word, you know,
for Sara had promised she would come at
eight, and there it was quarter to nine. She
said that it might be wiser next time to invite
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
somebody more reliable about keeping
engagements. Sara did not answer a word&mdash;only
went white as a sheet and walked out of
the room. Now she even cuts us&mdash;because
we were there&mdash;stares right over our heads
when we meet her anywhere.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure Gertrude was sorry the minute
she had spoken. And she&#8217;s been working
awfully hard over committees and the maids&#8217;
classes and the last play. She was tired and
nervous up to the brim, and then to wait and
wait and wait for Sara. Why, I was getting
cross myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, why doesn&#8217;t she beg Sara&#8217;s pardon
then, and make it all right?&#8221; demanded the
young judge severely. &#8220;Sara has always
simply worshiped her, but because she never
has made mistakes nor learned how to apologize,
and everybody admires her and flatters
her, she is too proud to say she was wrong.
It&#8217;s plain vanity&mdash;that&#8217;s what it is. She can&#8217;t
bear to make herself do it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s unhappy,&mdash;that&#8217;s what I think,
though she sort of pretends she doesn&#8217;t
care.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s cross as a bear&mdash;that&#8217;s what I think,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
snapped Bea, &#8220;and Sarah has dark circles
under her eyes. It&#8217;s dreadful&mdash;those two
girls who used to be inseparable! Quarrels
are&mdash;are horrible!&#8221; The impetus of this conviction
almost succeeded in hurling its proprietor
against the water cooler at the bathroom
door. &#8220;Say, Berta, what if you and
I should quarrel, with Robbie Belle and Lila
one thousand miles away?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m too amiable,&#8221; responded Berta complacently,
&#8220;sugar is sweet&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>The tin cup dropped with a flurried rattle
against the fudge pan. &#8220;Oh!&#8221; a shriek of
dismay, &#8220;my dear young and giddy friend,
we&#8217;re all out of sugar. What if we should
want to make anything to-night? Let&#8217;s run
back to the grocery by the kitchen this minute.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Owing to this delay, Gertrude had been in
the study for more than ten minutes, staring
out at the trees writhing in the wind, when
she was startled by the sound of a suffocated
shriek, followed by a scamper of four thick-soled
shoes, the heels smiting the corridor
floor with disgracefully mannish force. The
door flew inward vehemently, and Bea shot
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
clear across the room to collapse in the farthest
corner, hiding her face in the fudge pan
while her shoulders quivered and heaved terrifyingly.
Berta walked in behind her, and
after one reproachful look, sat down carefully
in a rocker and brushed her scarlet face before
beginning to giggle helplessly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the meanest person! Beatrice
Leigh, you knew I was turning into the
wrong alleyway, but you never said a word.
You wanted to see me disgraced. The door
opened like magic, and there she stood as if
she had slid through the keyhole. She stood
there plastered against the wall and&mdash;and&mdash;regarded
us&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; moaned Bea in ecstasy, one fiery
ear and half a cheek emerging from the
kindly shelter of the fudge pan, &#8220;she glared.
She wondered why those two idiotic individuals
were stalking toward her without a word
or knock or smile, when suddenly the hinder
one exploded and vanished, while the other
ignominiously&mdash;stark, mute, inglorious&mdash;fled,
ran, withdrew&mdash;so to speak&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you say something?&#8221; groaned
Berta. &#8220;I simply lost my wits from the surprise.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
She was the very last person I expected
to see anywhere around here. How in
the world did she happen to borrow the next
room to ours? She&#8217;ll think we were making
fun of her&mdash;that we did it on purpose. She&#8217;s
awfully sensitive anyhow!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you two are silly!&#8221; commented
Gertrude, her face again toward the driving
storm. &#8220;Who was it? Not a senior, I hope,
or a faculty?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bea straightened herself abruptly, the
laughter driven sternly out of every muscle
except one little twitching dimple at the
corner of her mouth. &#8220;It was Sara,&#8221; she
exclaimed, &#8220;and she is pale as a ghost. She
has never been so strong since waking up on
that boat and finding a burglar trying to
steal the ring off her finger during the holidays.
You know how she jumps at every
sudden noise, and she&#8217;s been getting thinner
and thinner, and I think you ought to be
ashamed of yourself clear down to the
ground.&#8221; Here the dimple vanished in
earnest. &#8220;I know I&#8217;m ashamed of myself,
and so&#8217;s Berta. Even her lips were white.
Now we&#8217;ve hurt her feelings worse. I didn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
think. Nice big splendid excuse for a sophomore,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the gong for luncheon,&#8221; was Gertrude&#8217;s
only reply as she moved toward the
door.
</p>
<p>Bea&#8217;s flare of denunciation had subsided
quickly in her characteristic manner. She
sat absently nibbling the handle of the obliging
pan, while staring after the receding
figure, its girlish slenderness stiffened as if to
warn away all friendliness. &#8220;She&#8217;s stubborner
than ever. I say, Berta, let&#8217;s reconcile
them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, let&#8217;s!&#8221; in echoing enthusiasm, adding
as the beauty of the plan glowed brighter,
&#8220;they&#8217;ll probably thank us to the last day
that they live. I know I would, if it were
Robbie and I who were drifting farther and
farther apart.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very likely,&#8221; responded the arch-conspirator,
beginning at the lower edge of the tin
doubtless itself delicious from long association
with dainties, &#8220;but the question is: How are
we going to do it? One is proud, and the
other is proud too. I don&#8217;t see exactly how
we can fix it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></p>
<p>As Berta did not see either, they decided
with considerable sound sense meanwhile to
go to luncheon. The next day after many
minutes of discouraging meditation mingled
with a few hours of tennis in the gymnasium,
an idea came to them. While they rested on
the window ledge, watching Gertrude stroll to
and fro in the sunshine balmy at last, Bea began
to waste her breath as usual.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;To-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow
drags out its weary course from day to
day,&#8217;&#8221; she quoted with mindless cheerfulness,
only to interrupt herself good naturedly,
&#8220;say, Berta, do you realize that the third to-morrow
aforementioned is April Fool&#8217;s Day?
I wish something interesting would happen.
This is the most monotonous place in vacation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow never is, it always will be,&#8221;
corrected the carping critic.
</p>
<p>Bea with indifference born of long endurance
paid no attention. &#8220;I say!&#8221; rapturously
as the idea began to dawn upon her inward
vision, &#8220;let&#8217;s reconcile them with a joke.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; agreed her partner with most
charming alacrity, &#8220;what joke?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span></p>
<p>The question was rather a poser, as Bea was
inclined to take only one step at a time and
utter one thought as it obligingly arrived,
without anxiety about the next. This tendency
had occasionally landed her high and
dry on the shores of nothingness in the classroom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, um-m-m, I haven&#8217;t determined that
point yet. It isn&#8217;t only great minds that
move slowly.&#8221; Gertrude&#8217;s cape swung into
view at the turn of the walk. &#8220;Berta, she
looks awfully lonesome, doesn&#8217;t she?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; argued the other, &#8220;nobody can expect
us to do all the tagging around ourselves,
especially where a contemporary is concerned.
If she wants us to walk with her, she might
omit a few snubs now and then. I&#8217;m tired of
chasing after her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The trouble is that you are not a faithful
friend, faithful friend,&#8221; rattled Bea, &#8220;man&#8217;s
faithful friend, the dog. Oh, oh, oh, Berta, I
have an idea!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Noble girl!&#8221; Berta patted her on the
head. &#8220;I generously refrain from comment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, sweetheart. I feared you
could not deny yourself that remark about
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
keeping my idea, as I might never get another.
But this one is an idea about a dog.
Let&#8217;s find a puppy to give Gertrude for a
soothing companion this vacation. I love
puppies.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The question is: does Gertrude also love
puppies? Or is it a joke?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s get a dog and surprise her with it
April Fool&#8217;s morning. He will be such a
friendly little fellow and so faithful that her
conscience will sting her&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must acknowledge that you are a
humane, tender-hearted individual. To plot a
stinging conscience&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, hush, Berta! Do be nice and agreeable.
I&#8217;m awfully tired this week, and I
really need some distraction. The corridors
stretch out empty and silent, and breakfast
doesn&#8217;t taste good at all, and&mdash;and I want to
do something for Sara.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, all right!&#8221; Berta spied the glint of an
excitable tear and shrugged the weight of
common sense from her shoulders. &#8220;I&#8217;m with
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Three days passed&mdash;three days of blue sky
and fluffy clouds and air that sent Bea dancing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
from end to end of the long stone wall
while Berta stumped conceitedly along the
path in her new rubber boots. Gertrude wondered
aloud why two presumably intelligent
young women insisted upon spending every
morning in foolish journeys over muddy
country roads. Noting an unaccustomed accent
of peevishness in the energetic voice,
Berta began to worry a bit over the likelihood
that such petulance was due to impending
sickness. Bea jeered at this, though with
covert side glances to detect any signs of fever.
In her secret soul, where she hid the notions
which she dimly felt looked best in the dark,
she reflected that an attack of some mild disease
might be a valuable form of retribution,
and also afford the invalid leisure to repent of
her sins. Still she did not quite like to mention
this thought aloud, as it seemed too unkindly
vengeful with regard to any one so obviously
miserable as Gertrude.
</p>
<p>One day on charitable plans intent the two
conspirators dragged Gertrude out across the
brown fields to have fun building a bonfire, as
they had done the previous spring. But
somehow the expedition was not much of a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
success&mdash;possibly because the wood was too
damp to burn inspiritingly. On that other
occasion Sara had been with them, and had
kept them laughing. She could say the funniest
things without stirring a muscle of her
small solemn face. That stump speech of hers
given from a genuine stump had sent them
actually reeling home. This year&mdash;alas!&mdash;while
returning to college rather silently, they
saw Sara plodding toward them with an air of
being out for sober exercise, not pleasure. The
moment she spied them, she deliberately retraced
her steps, and vanished through a hole
in the hedge. This incident set Gertrude to
chattering so excitedly about nothing in particular
that the others knew she cared even
more than they had fancied.
</p>
<p>On the evening of the last day of March,
Bea and Berta came rushing into the dining-room
twenty minutes late for dinner. When
they both declared that they did not want any
soup&mdash;their favorite kind, too&mdash;Gertrude
sighed impatiently over countermanding her
order to the maid. It seemed as if she were
not getting rested one bit this vacation, though
she did nothing but read novels all day long.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
She felt sometimes as if she were hurrying
every minute to escape from herself and her
own thoughts. Everything irritated her in
the strangest way. In all her busy healthful
life she had never been nervous before. It
was not hard work that had worn upon her.
The doctor told them when they were freshmen
that no girl ever broke down from work
unless worry was added. Gertrude knew perfectly
well what torturing little worry was
gnawing away in her mind. She kept telling
herself that her speech to Sara had been true&mdash;it
was so&mdash;Sara had broken her engagement&mdash;and
she could not, could not, could not
humble herself to apologize. In fact, Sara
was the one who ought to offer apologies.
And all this time wilful Gertrude refused to
acknowledge even to herself that she was juggling
with her conscience in the desperate determination
to hold herself free from blame
in her own esteem. She simply could not
beg anybody&#8217;s pardon, and she was not going
to do it, because&mdash;well, because she had not
been to blame&mdash;so there!
</p>
<p>On this particular evening, after five solid
minutes of silence on the part of her exasperating
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
roommates, she raised her heavy eyes,
and let them rest expressionlessly on the two
wind-freshened faces, till Bea&#8217;s roses blossomed
to her hair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not doing anything,&#8221; rebelliously,
&#8220;you are so boss-y.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Moo-oo,&#8221; muttered Berta to her plate.
&#8220;Bow-wow-wow.&#8221; Bea choked over her glass
and fled precipitately, leaving her partner to
capture a pitcher of milk ostensibly to drink
before going to bed.
</p>
<p>Of course they would have regretted missing
dessert as well as soup, if Gertrude had not
asked permission to carry some of the whipped
cream to her room. It was easier to do something
unnecessarily generous than to beg Sara&#8217;s
pardon&mdash;which was merely plain hard duty.
The girls were not in the study when she
entered with her offering, but soon Bea dashed
in and dropped breathlessly on the couch,
with a conspicuous effort to act as if accustomed
to arrive without her present double.
Gertrude listened unsuspiciously to the flurried
explanation that Berta was kept by a&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;friend,
before she revealed the brimming
trophy from dessert.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></p>
<p>Bea clapped her hands. &#8220;Oh, you darling!
the very thing! Won&#8217;t that pup&#8221;&mdash;an abrupt
and convulsive cough subsided brilliantly into,
&#8220;that pet of a Berta be pleased! I&#8217;ll take it to
her this instant.&#8221;
</p>
<p>However, she did not invite Gertrude to
accompany her, and upon her return after a
prolonged absence, she conducted herself with
odd restlessness. In the intervals of suggesting
that they put up an engaged sign or read
aloud or darn stockings or play patience before
going to a certain spread, she stared at the
clock. Promptly at eight she escaped from
the door, near which she had been lingering
for the past quarter-hour, with the carefully
distinct announcement that she was going
after Berta, and later she might attend the
spread.
</p>
<p>Five minutes later she was bending over a
fluffy little creature nestling on Gertrude&#8217;s
best pillow in one of the partitioned off bathrooms
at the end of the corridor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s been pretty good,&#8221; said Berta as she
surrendered the spoon, &#8220;and he likes the
cream, only the bubbles in it keep him awake,
I think. Somebody hammered at the door so
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
long that I had to stuff a lot into his mouth
every time he started to cry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bea assumed her station of nurse with businesslike
briskness. &#8220;Hurry back to Gertrude,
and coax her to go to that spread if you can.
She&#8217;s terribly blue to-night. Be sure to get
back here at nine, and I will take my turn at
the party so that nobody will be too curious
about this affair. At ten we shall both be
here to decide about the night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we can hook the door on the inside,
and climb over the partition. Won&#8217;t it be
fun! I wonder if I shouldn&#8217;t better practice
doing it now,&#8221; and Berta looked longingly at
the black walnut precipice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You trot along this instant, and don&#8217;t let
Gertrude suspect anything for the world. Be
just as natural as you know how&mdash;more than
ever before in your life. I reckon I shall put
him to sleep in a jiffy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Try it,&#8221; called the ex-nurse with laconic
scorn, &#8220;I&#8217;ll allow you the full hour for the
experiment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It must have been a very full hour indeed,
to judge from Bea&#8217;s feelings as the minutes
dawdled past. It seemed to her that instead
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
of flying with their sixty wings, according to
the rhyme, each minute trailed its feathers in
the dust as it shuffled along. At first, it was
amusing to watch for the mouth to open, and
then pop in a spoonful of cream. But this
soon became monotonous, especially when
she learned that no matter how long she sat
motionless beside the pillow, the bright little
eyes blinked wide awake at her slightest stir
to rise.
</p>
<p>It was lonesome in that end of the great
building. Their suite and Sara&#8217;s room next
to it were the only ones occupied in that
neighborhood during the vacation. This
bathroom was as much as forty steps distant
even from that populated spot, and not a
single footfall had sounded in the corridor
since Berta had disappeared into the gloom.
The light from the outer apartment glimmered
dully over the partition. At intervals
in the stillness, a drop of water clinked from
the faucet out there. Bea found herself holding
her breath to listen for the tinkle of its
splash. Outside the small window, a pale
moon was drifting among fluffy clouds.
</p>
<p>More than once Bea rose with exquisite
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
caution, and stole to the outer door, only to
hear a plaintive whine, while four clumsy
paws came pattering after her. Then followed
more minutes of soothing him with cream,
and watching for the little woolly sides to
cease heaving so piteously. Perhaps after all
it would have been wiser to have left this
troublesome joke with his mother on the
farm.
</p>
<p>By the time this vague suggestion had
wavered into her consciousness, the strain of
waiting and listening began to re-act on her
temper. Of course, Berta had forgotten all
about her watching there alone in the dark.
Berta was selfish and thoughtless and heedless.
That very afternoon, while they were
bringing the puppy to college, she had almost
tipped the buggy over into a puddle. Berta
had no right to impose upon her like this,
and make her do the worst part of the work
every time. Why, even when they went calling
together, Bea always had to do the knocking
and walk in first and manage the conversation
and everything. And now Berta was
having fun at the spread, and it must be near
ten o&#8217;clock, for the watchman had already
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
shuffled softly past and turned the gas still
lower. And she knew her foot was going to
sleep, and she could never feel the same
toward Berta Abbott again.
</p>
<p>Bea was so sorry for herself that her lip began
to quiver over a sobbing breath, when
steps came hurrying helter-skelter, the door
banged open, and Berta dived in.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Bea, I&#8217;m dreadfully sorry! I
couldn&#8217;t get away before. They held me&mdash;actually&mdash;and
made me jig for them, and sing
that last song I wrote. The preserved ginger
was so delicious that I saved some for you.
Nobody suspects a thing. How is the little
dear?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bea rose with impressive dignity till the
straightening of numb muscles inspired an
agonized, &#8220;Ouch!&#8221; and a stiff wriggle. It
was every bit Berta&#8217;s fault, and she evidently
didn&#8217;t care a snap. She would show people
whether they could walk all over her and
never say boo! She would not lose her
temper&mdash;oh, no! she would not utter a word&mdash;not
a single one of all the scorching things
she could think of. She would just be dignified
and self-possessed and teach certain persons
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
that she did not intend to be imposed
upon one instant longer. Therefore, Miss
Beatrice Leigh flung open the door and
stalked away without a backward glance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hulloa!&#8221; ejaculated Berta, staring
blankly after her, &#8220;what&#8217;s your rush?&#8221;
</p>
<p>No answer; merely a somewhat more defiant
swing of the slender shoulders vanishing
in the dusk of the deserted corridor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What shall we do with the dog? You
borrowed him&mdash;you&#8217;re responsible&mdash;it&#8217;s your
idea,&#8221; following in a puzzled flurry as far as
the threshold. &#8220;Shall I lock him in alone? I
said all along it was silly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Those insolent shoulders sailed silently
around the transverse and out of sight.
</p>
<p>After a petrified moment, Berta drew a deep
breath, and threw back her head while the
crimson of quick resentment flamed from
neck to hair. That was a nice way to be
treated, when she had simply done her best
not to arouse suspicion, exactly as Bea had
warned her. She took two steps hastily away
from the spot; then turned slowly and
glanced in at the soft heap of white showing
dimly on the darker blur of the pillow. She
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
certainly did not propose to spend the entire
night in playing nurse to anybody, especially
after Bea had insulted her so unpardonably.
It had been Bea&#8217;s idea all along too, and
Berta had worked herself nearly to death to
make it a success. The miles and miles she
had tramped through the mud&mdash;and all to no
result! Now everything was spoiled, and
everybody had quarreled with everybody else.
Whereupon Berta marched away to bed, leaving
the swinging door unhooked and the
outer door ajar. Bea was indisputably right
in criticising her fellow conspirator as heedless.
</p>
<p>At midnight Gertrude sprang from her pillow,
both arms flung out into the darkness,
every nerve quivering as she listened for a
second scream. She had chosen the inside
bedroom that had a window opening on the
corridor. Now in the breathless silence, she
heard a swift creak ending in the bang of an
up-flung sash. A swish of light garments,
a thud shaking the floor outside, and then
bare feet flying in frantic haste past her room
and into the alleyway.
</p>
<p>A crash against the study door, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
knob rattled wildly. &#8220;Let me in, quick,
quick! Help, Gertrude, help!&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a flash of white across the floor,
the lock grated, and Sara was in Gertrude&#8217;s
arms. Portières rustled apart, and two more
apparitions loomed pallidly in the dark.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hulloa!&#8221; gasped Berta&#8217;s voice, while a
woodeny click from Bea&#8217;s direction told of
Indian clubs snatched bravely in readiness
for war.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Light the gas, girls,&#8221; ordered Gertrude
quietly; &#8220;there, dear, don&#8217;t be frightened
now. See, we are all here. We will take
care of you. What was it startled you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. It was dark. Something
moved. I heard something. I was afraid.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gertrude felt her tremble, and held her
closer. Over the bowed head she spoke with
her lips to the other two. &#8220;That steamboat
shock.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bea caught the idea impulsively. &#8220;Oh,
Sara!&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;you&#8217;re only nervous.
You&#8217;ve often waked up and screamed a little
ever since that night on the boat. It&#8217;s nothing.
Crackie! but you frightened us at first!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sara lifted a white face. &#8220;This was different,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
she said; &#8220;this was something alive.
Hark!&#8221;
</p>
<p>They leaned forward, listening. Yes, there
was a footstep outside, muffled, stealthy. A
board creaked. Something was breathing.
</p>
<p>Gertrude and Berta looked at each other in
quick challenge for mutual courage. All the
other rooms at that end of the building were
vacant; the long dark corridor stretched out
its empty tunnel between them and available
help. What could four girls do?
</p>
<p>&#8220;We can scream,&#8221; said Bea.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lock the door&mdash;and the inner window&mdash;quick!&#8221;
Gertrude flew to one, Berta to the
other. &#8220;Sara, take this Indian club. Now
if it really is&mdash;anything, scream. But don&#8217;t
run. Don&#8217;t scatter. Scream&mdash;scream all together.
Ah!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The footsteps were coming down the alleyway
toward the door. Bea filled her lungs,
and opened her mouth in valiant preparation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wee-wee-wee, bow-wow!&#8221; Two little paws
scratched at the door.
</p>
<p>Bea&#8217;s breath issued in a feeble squeak, as
she dropped neatly down upon the floor and
buried her face in her hands.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></p>
<p>Berta swooped upon her. &#8220;The puppy!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gertrude felt herself freed from the encircling
arms. She moistened her lips. &#8220;I am
sorry, Sara, about the other night. I am&mdash;sorry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The pale little face upturned toward hers
began to glow as if touched with sunshine. &#8220;I
was late because Prexie kept me. I should
have explained, but&mdash;but it hurt. I knew
you were sorry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Berta sat up as if jerked into position by a
wire, and briskly brushed the hair out of her
eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen, Bea,&#8221; she whispered to a small
pink ear half hidden by red curls, &#8220;they&#8217;re
reconciled.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So are we,&#8221; said Bea, &#8220;please open the
door for the puppy.&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>CLASSES IN MANNERS</h3>
</div>

<p>Gertrude&#8217;s brother paid another visit to his
sister at Class Day. At least, he was supposed
to be visiting his sister, but it was really Bea
who took charge of him during all that radiant
June morning while Gertrude, as chairman
of the Daisy Chain committee, was busy
with her score of workers among the tubs of
long-stemmed daisies in a cool basement
room. Bea had immediately enrolled the
young man as her first assistant in the arduous
task of gathering armfuls of the starry flowers
in the field beyond the dormitories.
</p>
<p>After that labor was finished, and even Lila
had deserted her for the sake of an insensate
trunk that demanded to be packed, Bea conducted
her companion to the lake. There
through the golden hour of midday they
drifted in the shadow of the overhanging trees
along the shore. Once they paddled softly
around the little island at the end, and a colony
of baby mud-turtles went scrambling
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
madly from a log into the water. When the
brother began to fish for one with an oar,
Bea protested in a grieved tone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t seem to realize that I am
worrying about freckles every minute that we
stay out here in the broad sunlight. What
are trees for if not to provide shade for girls
without hats? And anyhow it is unkind to
seek to tear a turtle from his happy home. If
you do that, I shall never, never consent to
admit you to our highest class in manners.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Highest class in manners,&#8221; he echoed,
&#8220;that sounds promising. Is it another
story?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly is,&#8221; replied Bea, &#8220;and if you
are very good indeed and will keep the boat
close to the bank from the first word to the
last, I will tell you all about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Berta called it our classes in manners, but
Miss Anglin, our sophomore English teacher,
said that it was every bit as bad as gossip.
When Berta told her that she was the one
who had started us on it by advising us to
read character in the street-cars, she looked
absolutely appalled, and groaned, &#8220;What
next?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span></p>
<p>This was the beginning of it. When Miss
Anglin took charge of our essay work the
second semester, she explained that we should
be required to write a one-page theme every
day except Saturday and Sunday. Lila almost
fainted away, because she hates writing anything,
even letters home. Robbie Belle
looked scared, and I opened my mouth so
wide that my jaw ached for several minutes
afterward. But Berta kept her wits about
her. She said, &#8220;Miss Anglin, we are all living
here together, and we see the same things
every day. I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;ll be bored when
you read about them over and over. Why
can&#8217;t some of us choose intellectual topics?&#8221;
</p>
<p>By intellectual topics she meant subjects
that you can read up in the encyclopædia.
Miss Anglin sort of smiled. &#8220;Do you truly
think that you all see the same things day
after day? How curious! Have you ever
played a game called Slander?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Miss Anglin,&#8221; said Berta, and went
on to tell how the players sit in a circle, and
the first one whispers a story to the second;
and the second repeats it as accurately as she
can remember to the third; and the third tells
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
it to the fourth, and so on till the last one hears
it and then relates it aloud. After that the
first one gives the story exactly as he started
it. It is awfully interesting to notice the difference
between the first report and the last
one, because somehow each person cannot help
adding a little or leaving out a little in passing
it on to the next. That is the way slander
grows, you know. The gossip may be
true at first, or almost true, but it keeps
changing and getting worse and worse and
more thrilling as it spreads till finally it isn&#8217;t
hardly true at all. That is how our classes in
manners turned out.
</p>
<p>Well, to go back to that day in the rhetoric
section. Miss Anglin saw that we were discouraged
before we had commenced and we
didn&#8217;t know how to start; and so she began
to suggest subjects. For instance, she said,
one girl might wake up in the morning&mdash;&mdash;Oh,
but I am forgetting her application of the
illustration from the game of Slander. She
said that if no two persons receive the same
impression from a whispered story spoken in
definite words, it is probable that no two pairs
of eyes see the same thing in the same way, to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
say nothing of the ideas aroused in the different
brains behind the eyes. One girl might
wake up in the morning, as I was saying, and
when she looks from the window she sees
snow everywhere&mdash;provided it did snow during
the night, you understand. Then she
writes her daily theme about the beautiful
whiteness, the shadows of bare trees, diamond
sparkles everywhere and so forth. Another
girl looks out of that very same window at the
same time, and she doesn&#8217;t think of the
beautiful snow merely as snow; she thinks of
coasting or going for a sleigh-ride or something
like that. And so her theme very
likely will prove to be a description of a coasting
carnival or tobogganing which she once
enjoyed. Another girl looks out and thinks
first thing, &#8220;Oh, now the skating is spoiled!&#8221;
Her theme maybe will tell how she learned
to skate by pushing a chair ahead of her on
the ice.
</p>
<p>Berta raised her hand again. &#8220;Well, but,
Miss Anglin,&#8221; she said, &#8220;suppose it doesn&#8217;t
snow?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Berta is not really stupid, you know, quite
the reverse indeed, but she is used to having
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
the girls laugh at what she says. They
laughed this time, and Miss Anglin did too,
because she knew Berta was just drawing her
out, so to speak. She went on to give other
examples about the things we see while out
walking or shopping or at a concert, and finally
she drifted around to character-reading. She
said a street-car was a splendid field for that.
The next time one of us rode into town, she
might try observing her fellow travelers.
There might be a working-man in a corner,
with a tin-bucket beside him. Maybe he
would be wearing an old coat pinned with a
safety-pin. By noting his eyes and the expression
of his mouth the girl could judge
whether he was just shiftless or untidy merely
because his wife was too busy with the children
to sew on buttons. She told a lot of interesting
things about the difference between
the man who holds his newspaper in one hand
and the man who holds his in both. Some
temperaments always lean their heads on their
hands when they are weary, and others support
their chins. A determined character sets
her feet down firmly and decidedly at every
step&mdash;though of course it needn&#8217;t be thumping&mdash;while
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
a dependent chameleon kind of a
woman minces along uncertainly. Why,
sometimes just from the angle at which a person
lifts his head to listen, you can tell if he
has executive ability or not.
</p>
<p>Before the bell rang at the end of the hour,
we were awfully enthusiastic about reading
character. The first thing Robbie Belle did
was to stumble over the threshold.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oho!&#8221; jeered Berta, &#8220;you&#8217;re careless.
That&#8217;s as easy as alpha, beta, gamma.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She meant a, b, c, you understand, but she
prefers to say it in Greek, being a sophomore.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But she isn&#8217;t careless,&#8221; protested Lila,
&#8220;she&#8217;s the most careful person I ever met.
The sole of her shoe is split, and that is the
reason she stumbled.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why is it split?&#8221; demanded Berta in her
most argumentative tone; &#8220;would a nobly
careful and painstakingly fastidious person
insist upon wearing a shoe with a split sole?
No, no! Far from it. If she had stumbled
because the threshold wasn&#8217;t there, or because
she had forgotten it was there, the inference
would be at fault. I should impute the defect
to her mentality instead of to her character,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
alas! A stumble plus a split sole! Ah, Robbie
Belle, I must put you in a daily theme.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Robbie Belle looked alarmed. &#8220;Indeed,
Berta, I&#8217;d rather not. I was going to trim it
off neatly this morning, but I have lent my
knife to Mary Winchester.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha! lent her your knife!&#8221; declaimed
Berta sternly, &#8220;another clue! This must be
investigated. Why did she borrow your
knife?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To sharpen her pencil,&#8221; answered Robbie.
&#8220;I made her take it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Her pencil! Her pencil!&#8221; muttered
Berta darkly, &#8220;why her pencil? Are there
not pens? Mayhap, &#8217;tis not her pencil. Alas,
alas! Her also I thrust into a daily theme.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s snippy about returning things,&#8221;
said Lila, &#8220;she acts as if she didn&#8217;t care
whether you do her a favor or not. I don&#8217;t
like her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s queer,&#8221; I said.
</p>
<p>Now I had a perfect right to say that because
it was true. Mary Winchester was just
about the queerest girl in college. Everybody
thought so. But I shall say no more at present,
as her queerness is the subject of the rest
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
of this story. If I told you immediately just
how she was queer and all the rest of it, there
wouldn&#8217;t be any story left, would there?
</p>
<p>Well, as the weeks whirled past, we studied
character and wrote daily themes till we were
desperate. Robbie Belle grew sadder and
sadder until Berta suggested that she might
describe the gymnasium, the chapel, the
library, the drawing rooms, the kitchen, and
so forth, one by one, telling the exact size and
position of everything. That filled up quite
a number of days. When Miss Anglin put a
little note of expostulation, so to speak, on the
theme about the corridor&mdash;it was, &#8220;This is a
course in English, not mathematics, if you
please,&#8221;&mdash;Berta started her in on the picture
gallery. There were enough paintings there
to last till the end of the semester. Of course,
such work did not require her to read character.
Robbie Belle didn&#8217;t want to do that
somehow; she said it seemed too much like
gossip.
</p>
<p>However, at first, it wasn&#8217;t gossip. For
instance one day Lila and I collected smiles.
We scurried around the garden and dived in
and out of the hedge in order to meet as many
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
people as possible face to face. Then we took
notes on the varieties of greeting and made up
themes about them. Miss Anglin marked an
excellent on mine that time. For another
topic we paid one-minute calls on everybody
we knew. When they looked surprised and
inquired why we did not sit down, we frankly
explained that we were gathering material for
an essay on Reading Character from the Way
a Person says &#8220;Come in!&#8221;
</p>
<p>After we had been grinding out daily
themes for three weeks we began to long for
something to break the monotony. My brain
was just about wrung dry, and Lila said she
simply loathed the sight of a sheet of blank
paper. One afternoon while I was struggling
over my theme, Berta threw a snowball
against my window, flew up the dormitory
steps, sped down the corridor, gave a double
rat-tat-too on my door, and burst in without
waiting for an answer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen! Quick! I have an idea. It
struck me out by the hedge. Why not study
manners as well as character? Why not
divide&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go away. That snowball plop against the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
pane spoiled my best sentence. This is due
in forty minutes. I&#8217;ve written up my family
and friends and books and pictures, my summer
vacations&mdash;a sunset at a time, my
little&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not divide everybody, I say&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&mdash;&mdash;dog at home,&#8221; I continued placidly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve composed themes about the orchard,
the woods, the table-fare, the climate, the kitten
I never owned, the thoughts I never had.
To-day I was in despair for a subject till I
happened to borrow one of your cookies
and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You did! My precious cookies! Burglar!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&mdash;&mdash;bite it into scallops. Ha! an idea! I
arranged myself on the rug with much care in
order that I might stretch out the process to a
whole page of narration. Thereupon I nibbled
off the corners of the scallops till the
cookie was round and smooth again. Next I
bit it into scallops and then I nibbled off the
corners; and next I bit and then I nibbled;
and next I bit and then I nibbled; and next
I bit&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You did! Oh, I wish I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&mdash;&mdash;and then I nibbled; and next I bit
and then I nibbled, till there was nothing left
but the hole. Now I am writing a scintillating
and corruscating theme about it. Go
away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Berta turned toward the door. &#8220;Some day
you&#8217;ll wish you had listened,&#8221; she declared in
accents heavy with gloom, &#8220;some day when
you can&#8217;t think of a single thing to write
about, and the hand keeps moving around
the clock, and the paper lies there blank and
horrible before your vacant eyes, and your
pen is nibbled so short that your fingers&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean go away,&#8221; I said, &#8220;I meant,
go on. Tell me about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nay, nay! To lacerate my feelings, spurn
my proffered aid, insult my youthful pristine
zeal, and then to call me back&mdash;in short, to
throw a dog a bone! Nay, nay!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Berta, be sweet. Tell me. You know
that I think you have the most original ideas
in college.&#8221; After I had coaxed her quite a
lot, she told me her new scheme. It was
something like advanced character reading
and biology combined. Just as scientists classify
trees and plants in botany, Berta proposed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
that we should divide the students into different
classes according to their manners.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be so improving and instructive
too,&#8221; she pleaded, &#8220;we&#8217;ll be paragons of
politeness before we finish them all. We&#8217;ll be
so particular about our highest class that we
will notice every little thing and thus take
warning.&#8221; She paused a moment; then,
&#8220;Did you hear me say thus?&#8221; she inquired.
When I nodded, she gazed at me sadly.
&#8220;People who belong to the highest class never
gesticulate; they use spoken language exclusively.
Furthermore, as to the thus. I
wondered if an up-springing sense of courtesy
persuaded you to refrain from hooting at such
elegant verbiage. That would be a sign of
benefit already derived from the classes. By
the way, it was Mary Winchester who inspired
the idea.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but she has no manners at all!&#8221; I exclaimed
before I thought.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is precisely the point. I met her
flying along like a wild creature on her
bicycle, eyes staring, hair streaming in the
wind. At least, some locks were streaming.
She gave the impression of a being utterly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
lawless. Then I thought&mdash;&mdash;See here, Miss
Leigh, are you interested in my thoughts?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m,&#8221; I answered meekly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then drop that pen and pay attention.
Even the girls who are to belong to the second
class in manners know how to do that. Well,
I thought that she hardly ever accepts an invitation,
and she looks as she didn&#8217;t expect
anybody to like her, and she minds her own
business and does exactly as she pleases generally.
My next important thought was that
sometimes she cuts me in the hall, and sometimes
she doesn&#8217;t, just as she happens to feel.
That led to the philosophic reflection that
politeness is a question of law.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, pardon me, Miss Abbott, but I remember
from a story which was read by my
teacher about forty years ago when I was in
the fourth reader that
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;&#8216;Politeness is to do or say</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>The kindest thing in the kindest way.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I meant. The law of kindness&mdash;that&#8217;s
what politeness is. Listen to the
logic. Mary Winchester is lawless, hence she
breaks the law of kindness, hence she has no
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
manners, hence it will be fun to divide everybody
here into various classes according to
their manners.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So that is the way our classes began.
</p>
<p>It was awfully, awfully interesting. Robbie
Belle said she didn&#8217;t want to; but Berta
and Lila and I talked and talked and talked.
We sat in the windows and talked instead of
dancing between dinner and chapel. We
talked after chapel, and on our way to classes
or to meals. And of course we talked while
we were skating or walking or doing anything
similar that did not demand intellectual application.
Lila even talked about the classes in
her sleep. We discussed everybody who happened
to attract our attention.
</p>
<p>Finally we had sifted out all the candidates
for the highest class except three. One was
the senior president, pink and white and slender
and gentle and she never thumped when
she walked or laughed with her mouth open
or was careless about spots on her clothes or
forgot the faces of new girls who had been introduced
to her. The second was a professor
who was shy and sweet and went off lecturing
every week. The third was a teacher who
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
looked like a piece of porcelain and always
wore silk-lined skirts and never changed the
shape of her sleeves year after year. Not one
of the three ever hurt anybody&#8217;s feelings.
</p>
<p>Miss Anglin was obliged to go into the second
class because she had moods. No, I
don&#8217;t mean because she had them,&mdash;for sometimes
you cannot help having moods, you
know&mdash;but because she showed them. She
let the moods influence her manner. Some
mornings she would come down to breakfast
as blue as my dyed brilliantine&mdash;(how I hated
that frock!)&mdash;and would sit through the meal
without opening her mouth except to put
something into it; though on such occasions
we noticed that she rarely put into it very
much besides toast and hot water. On other
days she made jokes and sparkled and
laughed with her head bent down, and was
so absolutely and utterly charming that the
girls at the other tables wished they sat at
ours, I can tell you. We three were exceedingly
fond of her, but we agreed at last after
arguing for seven days that true courtesy
makes a person act cheerfully and considerately,
no matter how she may feel inside.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span></p>
<p>There were about nine in that second class,
and fourteen in the third and twenty in the
fourth, when we started in on Mary Winchester.
</p>
<p>Lila and I were rushing to get ready for the
last skating carnival of the season. Some
one knocked at the door. It was Mary, but
she didn&#8217;t turn the knob when I called,
&#8220;Come.&#8221; She just waited outside and gave
me the trouble of opening it myself. Then in
her offish way she asked if we were through
with her lexicon. After I had hunted it up
for her, she happened to notice that Lila was
wailing over the disappearance of her skates.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw a pair of strange skates in my
room,&#8221; she said and walked away as indifferent
as you please.
</p>
<p>Now wouldn&#8217;t any one think that was
queer?
</p>
<p>It made Lila cross, especially when she found
that the skates had three new spots of rust on
them. March is an irritable month, anyhow,
you know. Everybody is tired, and breakfast
doesn&#8217;t taste very good. She sputtered about
the rust till we reached the lake where we
found two big bonfires and three musicians to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
play dance music while we skated. Imagine
how lovely with the flames leaping against the
background of snowy banks and bare black
trees! Berta and Lila and I crossed hands and
skated around and around the lake with the
crowd. When we stopped in the firelight, Lila
looked unusually pretty with her rosy cheeks
and her curls frosted by her breath. Berta&#8217;s
eyes were like stars. Of course Robbie Belle
was beautiful, but she did not associate much
with us that evening. After one turn up and
back again while we discussed Mary Winchester,
she said she thought she would invite our
little freshman roommate for the next number.
</p>
<p>We kept on talking about Mary. Lila was
insisting that she ought to be put in the tenth
class or worse, while Berta maintained that
she wasn&#8217;t quite so bad as that. I kept
thinking up arguments for both sides.
</p>
<p>Lila counted off her crimes, and she didn&#8217;t
speak so very low either. &#8220;Mary Winchester
doesn&#8217;t deserve a place even in the tenth class.
Why, listen now. You admit that she borrows
disgracefully and never returns things.
At least, she helped herself to my skates. It
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
is almost the same as stealing. She has no
friends. She always goes off walking alone,
and sits in the gallery by herself at lectures
and concerts. Everybody says she is
queer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Anglin thinks girls in the mass are
funny,&#8221; I volunteered, &#8220;though maybe they
are not any more so than human kind in the
bulk. She says that we all imagine we admire
originality, but when we see any one
who is noticeably different from the rest, we
avoid her. We call her queer and are afraid
to be seen with her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mary Winchester&#8217;s independence is commendable,&#8221;
protested Berta. &#8220;I envy her
strength of character. She ignores foolish
conventions&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;As for instance, the distinction between
mine and thine,&#8221; interrupted Lila, &#8220;you don&#8217;t
live next to her, and you don&#8217;t know. Her
disregard for the property rights of others indicates
a fatal flaw&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fatal flaw, fatal flaw!&#8221; chanted Berta
mischievously, &#8220;isn&#8217;t that a musical phrase!
Say it fast now, and see if it tangles your
tongue.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></p>
<p>I was afraid Lila would feel wounded, so I
remarked hastily that we agreed that Mary
was not polite; the question was as to the degree
of impoliteness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Even Robbie Belle acknowledges that she
is not a lady,&#8221; chimed in Berta; &#8220;she said it
when Mary wanted to take that stray kitten
to the biological laboratory. She declared it
would be happier if dead.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And it wasn&#8217;t her kitten either,&#8221; I contributed.
&#8220;Robbie found it up a tree. It is
necessary to weigh every little point in a
scientific study like this.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you see, girls, that Mary Winchester
does not come from good stock,&#8221; began Lila,
&#8220;of course she isn&#8217;t a lady. Her attitude toward
the rights of others is certain proof that
her family has a defective moral sense. Perhaps
her brother&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, let&#8217;s follow out the logical deductions,&#8221;
cried Berta. &#8220;That course in logic is the
most fascinating in the whole curriculum.
See&mdash;if a girl lacks moral judgment, she either
inherits or acquires the defect. If she inherits
it, her father doubtless was dishonest.
Maybe he speculated and embezzled or gambled
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
or something. If she acquired it through
environment, her brother must have suffered
likewise as they were presumably brought
up together. So perhaps Mary Winchester&#8217;s
brother was expelled from college for kleptomania.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Lila triumphantly, &#8220;how
can we possibly put her into even the lowest
of our classes in manners?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi, there!&#8221; I started to scream before the
breath was knocked out of me by colliding
with some girls who had been skating in front
of us. One of them had caught her skate in
a crack, and we were so intent on our conversation
that we bumped into them, and all
tumbled in a heap. Nobody was hurt. That
is, nobody was hurt physically. We picked
ourselves up and went on skating as before. It
was not until days later that we discovered
what had been hurt then. It was Mary Winchester&#8217;s
reputation. Those girls in front had
overheard part of our remarks. And they
thought that we were talking about real facts
instead of just analyzing character.
</p>
<p>It was exactly like a game of slander, only
worse. The rumor that Mary Winchester&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
father was a gambler and that her brother
had been expelled from college for stealing
spread and grew like fire. You know, as I
said before, she was a queer girl&mdash;so queer in
countless small ways that she was conspicuous.
Even freshmen who did not know her name
had wondered about the tall, wild-looking girl
who had a habit of tearing alone over the
country roads as if trying to get away from
herself. Naturally when such a report as this
one of ours reached them, they adopted it as
a satisfactory explanation. They also, so to
speak, promulgated it.
</p>
<p>The first we knew of the rumor was from
Robbie Belle. It was the afternoon before the
Easter vacation, and Lila and I were in Berta&#8217;s
room to help her pack her trunk. At least
Lila held the nails while Berta mended the
top tray and I did the heavy looking on.
When Berta stopped hammering and put her
thumb in her mouth, I remarked that nobody
who squealed ouch! in company could belong
to our highest class in manners.
</p>
<p>Lila&#8217;s expression changed from the pained
sympathy of friendship to the scientific zeal
of character study. &#8220;Girls, have you noticed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
Mary Winchester lately? It is the strangest
thing! She seems more alone and alien than
ever. The girls avoid her as if she had the
plague. In the library and the corridor to-day
it was as plain as could be. They stop
talking when she comes around. They watch
her all the time though they try not to let
her know it. Of course, she couldn&#8217;t help
feeling it. They point her out to each other,
and raise their brows and whisper after she
has passed. She moves on with her head up
and her mouth set tight. Her manners are
worse than ever.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;When I met her this morning, she looked
right through me and didn&#8217;t see anything
there, I reckon,&#8221; said I, &#8220;and, oh, Lila, you
were mistaken about her borrowing your
skates without leave. It was Martha who
had them that morning. In rushing to class
she got mixed up and threw them in at the
wrong door, that&#8217;s all. Our example is corrupting
the infant.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Berta forgot her aching thumb. &#8220;Something
is wrong. Mary&#8217;s eyes are those of a
hunted creature. Driven into a corner.
Everybody against her. I wonder&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span></p>
<p>Robbie Belle walked slowly into the room,
her clothes dripping with water.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mary Winchester fell into the lake,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;you did it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In the silence I heard Berta draw a long
sigh. Then she dropped her hammer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She broke through the ice,&#8221; added Robbie
Belle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the ice is rotten. How did she get
on it?&#8221; asked my voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She walked,&#8221; answered Robbie Belle, &#8220;I
saw her.&#8221; Then she crossed over to Berta,
put both arms around her neck, hid her face
against her shoulder, and began to shake all
over. &#8220;I helped pull her out, and she fought
me&mdash;she fought&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>At that moment little Martha, our freshman
roommate, came running in. &#8220;That
queer girl jumped into the lake. I saw them
carrying her to the infirmary. She did it because
everybody knows her father is in the
penitentiary. They heard about it at the
skating carnival. Her brother is an outlaw
too&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Robbie Belle lifted her head. &#8220;She hasn&#8217;t
any brother, but it is true about her father.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
The doctor knows. She wonders how the
story got out. It was a secret. Mary changed
her name. She&mdash;she fought me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I heard Berta sigh again. It sounded loud.
Lila sat staring straight in front of her with
such a horrified expression on her white face
that I shut my eyes quick.
</p>
<p>When I opened them again, Miss Anglin
stood in the doorway. I never was so glad to
see anybody in all my life. But we did not
tell her then about our classes in manners.
We waited till one day in June when she
asked us how we had managed to win Mary
out of her shell.
</p>
<p>As I look back now I cannot possibly
understand how we succeeded. It was the
most discouraging, hopeless, hardest work I
ever stuck to. Over and over again Berta and
I would have given up if it had not been for
Lila. She said that she dared not fail. Of
course Robbie Belle helped a lot in her steady,
beautiful way. Martha did her best too, partly
because she was so sorry about her share in the
affair of the skates. In fact all the girls were
perfectly lovely to Mary after the doctor had
persuaded her not to throw everything up
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
and run away to hide. By and by she
realized that it was no use to refuse to be
friends.
</p>
<p>Indeed she is a dear girl when you get to
know her real self. Her unfortunate manner&mdash;it
was unfortunate, you know&mdash;had been a
sort of armor to shield her sore pride. She
had been afraid of letting anybody have a
chance to snub her. That was the reason
why she had seemed so offish and suspicious
and indifferent and lawless and queer.
</p>
<p>Do you know, I never heard Robbie Belle
say a sharp thing except once. She said it
that day when we were telling Miss Anglin
about the classes. It was: &#8220;Whenever I
want to say something mean about anybody,
I think I shall call it a scientific analysis of
character.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>THIS VAIN SHOW</h3>
</div>

<p>It was the first evening at college in their
junior year. Upon coming out of the dining-room
Lila caught sight of Bea waiting at the
elevator door. Dodging three seniors, a maid
with a tray, and a man with a truck full of
trunks, she made a dash for the new arrival
who in a sudden freak of perversity danced
tantalizingly just beyond reach.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You imp! And I haven&#8217;t seen you for
three months. Help me!&#8221; she beckoned to
Berta who that moment emerged from dinner,
&#8220;run around that side and catch her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Bea, swiftly subsiding from her mischievous
agility, stood still and regarded them
with an air of surprised, sad dignity as the two
flung themselves upon her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Young ladies, I am astonished at such
behavior. Leading juniors&mdash;real, live, brand-new
juniors&mdash;and to display such lack of self-restraint,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
such disdain of gracefulness and
repose! Oh!&#8221; her voice changed magically,
&#8220;oh, you, dear sweet, darling girls, I love you
pretty well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why,&#8221; queried Berta, gasping as she
released herself, &#8220;then why, I repeat, do you
endeavor to choke us to death?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; answered Bea, as she meekly
allowed Lila to straighten her hat while
Berta rescued her satchel from the middle of
the corridor, &#8220;because you are so nice and
noble and haven&#8217;t any false feeling about
little tokens of affection like that. In fact,
you haven&#8217;t any false pride or anything false,
and I have a tale of woe to tell you by and
by. Hereafter I intend to be a typical college
girl, not an exception.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The promised by and by proved to be the
hour of unpacking after chapel services.
While Bea was emptying her satchel that
night she snatched up a little fringed napkin
and shook it vigorously before the other girls.
</p>
<p>&#8220;See the crumbs! Thereby hangs the tale.
Now, listen.
</p>
<p>This summer we have been feeling rather
poor at home, you know. My father&#8217;s firm
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
was forced to make an assignment. It wasn&#8217;t
his fault, you understand; it was because of
the hard times. Every few days we would
hear of a bank closing its doors or a factory
shutting down. People have been cutting off
expenses in all directions. Of course my
family has to economize. I am thankful
enough to be able to come back to college.
About a dozen girls in the class have dropped
out this year of the panic. I knew that I
could earn fifty dollars or more by tutoring
and carrying mail, if I once got here. That
will help quite a lot toward books and postage
and ordinary personal expenses. Father said
he could manage the five hundred for board
and tuition. You had better believe that I do
not intend to be needlessly extravagant, when
my mother is keeping house without a maid,
and my father is riding to his office on a
bicycle.
</p>
<p>Now I rather suspect that this explanation
is no excuse for the foolish way I behaved on
the journey to college that September. But
the summer has been so horrid, and two or
three acquaintances changed around after the
failure and treated us as if we had ceased to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
be worth noticing. Of course I know that
such persons are not worth noticing themselves,
still it did hurt a little. I guess the
reason why I pretended to have plenty of
money while traveling with Celia was because
I was afraid of being hurt again. And then
too I remembered how she had said one evening
the year before when we were playing
Truth that she despised stinginess beyond any
other vice. That had made an impression on
me because I was just going to say the very
same thing myself.
</p>
<p>Celia is a new student who is to join our
class this year. We met her last spring when
she came up from a boarding-school in New
York to visit a senior. You remember her?
It was at a fudge party in her honor that we
played the game of Truth, to which I have
already alluded. She is the kind of person
who is generally asked to be an usher at a
hall play or on Founder&#8217;s Day. She is tall,
holds her head high, has an air. The doctor
herself said when she saw her in chapel the
evening of her visit, &#8220;Who is that striking
girl?&#8221; She dresses beautifully too; and I
think I shall ask her to let me put down her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
name for two dances next month, if my cousin
and his roommate come from Yale for the reception.
</p>
<p>Being new to the college atmosphere, she
had an excuse for the way she acted on the
journey. An excuse that I did not have, you
know&mdash;and I know too. But as for that,
more anon, anon! At present I start in and
continue by stating that on a certain September
day I was sitting by myself in the Union
Station at Chicago, while I waited for my
train. I had arrived two hours before, and I
was hungry, and I was also, as explained
above, strongly inclined to be economical.
And therefore I was eating my luncheon out
of a pasteboard box, instead of going to a
restaurant.
</p>
<p>On my lap was a fringed napkin upon which
reposed one slice of chocolate cake with frosting,
one big peach, and seven large white
grapes each containing at least three seeds.
Just at the very moment when I took a bite
of the peach, hoping that none of the weary
passengers around me was taking notes, for
that peach was certainly juicy,&mdash;just at that
exact moment, I happened to glance across to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
the door. There was Celia Lane, with her
head higher than ever, looking up and down
for an empty seat. And the only empty seat
in the whole waiting-room was next to mine.
And my lap was strewn with an economical
luncheon.
</p>
<p>It was silly of me. I admit that once and
forever, and shall not repeat it again. But
like lightning her remark about stinginess
flashed into my mind. Before she had taken
the second step in my direction, I had crammed
all those seven grapes into my mouth, bundled
the napkin with crumbs, cake and pit
into my satchel, shoved it under the bench,
and rose nonchalantly swallowing the grapes
whole as I haughtily lifted my chin in order
to survey my worthless companions. Then of
course my eyes fell upon her, and I started
forward in vivacious greeting.
</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe she had recognized me before,
for she said, &#8220;Oh!&#8221; with a queer little
gasp. Then she put out her hand in that cordial
way of hers. It made me think that I
was the person she had been longing to find.
She inquired what road I was going on, and
said, &#8220;Ah, yes, what a charming coincidence!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
But honestly it seemed to me that there was
a worried expression in her eyes.
</p>
<p>And there I sat miserably shaking in my
old shoes. It may appear funny to you, but
it was an awful feeling. Even now months
afterward I never want to smile at the memory.
You see, it costs five dollars to ride in a
Pullman car from Chicago to New York. I
had planned to go into the common passenger
coach until nightfall, and thus save two dollars
and a half toward books for the new
semester. That sounds a bit mean and sordid,
doesn&#8217;t it? And I know my family
would have objected if I had told them, because
the sleeping-cars are much safer in case
of accidents. Oh, how I hated to say anything
about it! You can&#8217;t imagine. I wonder how
Berta would express it with literary vividness.
Maybe she might say that she &#8220;shrank in every
fibre.&#8221; But it was worse than that&mdash;I just
didn&#8217;t want to, I simply couldn&#8217;t.
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<a name='linki_5' id='linki_5'></a>
<img src='images/img-205.jpg' alt='' title='' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
WE HANDED OVER FIVE DOLLARS APIECE
<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></div>
<p>The hand of the clock kept moving around&mdash;oh,
lots faster than it had done before Celia
appeared. When it was nearly time for the
train to be ready, I began to mutter and mumble
and finally managed to remark that I
thought I had better see about engaging my
berth. What do you suppose? She gave a
sort of astonished jump and exclaimed, &#8220;Why,
I must too.&#8221; So we both marched over to the
agent&#8217;s window and handed over five dollars
apiece. I was dying to ask her to go shares
with me, because one berth is plenty&mdash;or, I
mean almost plenty&mdash;large enough for two.
But though I opened my mouth a few times
and coughed once, I absolutely did not dare
to propose such a penurious plan. She might
have thought me close-fisted, and perhaps she
would not have slept very well either.
</p>
<p>No sooner had we settled ourselves in the
sleeper, than I began to worry about the meals.
Naturally she would assume that I intended
to go into the dining-car every time. Most of
the girls do as a matter of course. In fact I
remember feeling condescending whenever I
saw anybody eating from a box while the
other passengers were filing down the aisle, or
up, whichever it happened to be. This year
I was to be one of the brave unfortunates left
behind in their seats.
</p>
<p>Well, very likely you understand that people
while traveling really ought not to eat so
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
heartily as usual. Much food in a dining-car
clogs the system and ventilates the pocketbook,
so to speak. I appreciated myself hard for
being right and noble and abstemious and foresighted&mdash;with
respect to the semester&#8217;s expenses,
you perceive, and also self-denying and
self-reliant. There are a number of selfs in
that sentence, likewise in the idea and in my
mind at the time. I don&#8217;t believe honestly
that poverty is good for the character, though
Berta says that she knows it isn&#8217;t good for
anything else.
</p>
<p>Celia and I went out to sit on the rear platform
of the observation-car. The scenery was
not particularly interesting in comparison
with Colorado; and consequently I had spare
energy for meditating on Emerson&#8217;s essays and
his observation that &#8220;What I must do is all
that concerns me, not what the people think.&#8221;
I wish I were strong-minded. To reflect sincerely,
however, I don&#8217;t believe it is so much
a question of a strong mind as of a weak imagination.
If I had been unable to imagine
what Celia might think, doubtless I wouldn&#8217;t
have bothered about it.
</p>
<p>But I was bothered. The sensation of botheration
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
deepened and swelled and widened as
supper time drew nearer and nearer, and
every moment I expected to hear the waiter&#8217;s
voice intoning behind me, &#8220;Supper is now
ready in the dining-car.&#8221; What made this
state of affairs all the sadder was the memory
of springing gladness inspired by the same
sound on previous journeys. I sat there
dreading and dreading and dreading. And
then, what do you think? Celia was asking
me about Lila and Berta and Robbie Belle
and the fun we have and incidentally something
about the work. I was talking so fast
that I forgot all about being poor. When the
waiter&#8217;s voice suddenly rang out at the end of
the car, I jumped up instantly just as I had
always done on former occasions of the same
nature. And I exclaimed, &#8220;I am simply
starved to death.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then I remembered and sat down so quickly
that my camp-chair tipped against Celia and
knocked her over so that she might have fallen
off the platform if there had not been a
railing around it. That catastrophe created
such a flurry of anxieties, apologies, and so
forth, that I succeeded in letting the crisis
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
slip past unmolested. At least, that first
crisis did. The second crisis arrived a little
later when the voice behind us rang out again
with, &#8220;Second call to supper in the dining-car.&#8221;
I glanced sidewise at Celia just in time
to catch her glancing sidewise at me. That
made me spring lightly to my feet, I can tell
you. Was she getting suspicious? Was she
too courteous to suggest an extravagance the
refusal of which might hurt my pride? Was
she wondering why I seemed to have forgotten
that I was starving to death, if not already
starved?
</p>
<p>So I said in a tone of patient consideration,
&#8220;Shall we wait any longer, Miss Lane?&#8221;
She jumped up like a flash, and her face was
quite red.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed! Not on my account certainly.&#8221;
She emphasized the my so distinctly
that I was sure she suspected. That dreadful
thought caused me to stiffen my manner, and
as hers had been strangely stiff all the afternoon,
we were awfully polite to each other
during supper. Each of us insisted upon paying
the bill and feeing the waiter. It was terrible.
I couldn&#8217;t afford to pay it all, and yet
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
I was too silly to give in gracefully, especially
as some other passengers were listening, and
the waiter hovered near. Finally it resulted
in his receiving twice the sum, half for the
bill, and half for a fee. I hope he appreciated
it.
</p>
<p>Then we talked politely to each other for an
hour or two before going to bed. And in the
morning, there was the problem of breakfast
confronting me.
</p>
<p>The problem woke me early. Being poor is
bad for the health as well as bad for the character,
I think. Probably it is bad for the soul
also. Or maybe it is not the poverty so much
as being ashamed of it that perverts a person&#8217;s
life. Well, actually I almost cherished the
deceitful plot of getting up so early that I
should be already dressed before Celia would
appear, and then I could tell her that I had
been so hungry that I had eaten my breakfast
alone. It would have been true too, because
I intended to nibble my malted milk tablets
behind a magazine. But this plan came to
naught; for when I poked my head out between
the curtains I saw Celia herself staggering
toward the dressing-room with her satchel.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
Thereupon I lay down again and nibbled the
tablets in the berth. That would enable me
to assert truthfully that I was not hungry and
did not care for breakfast in the diner.
</p>
<p>Oh, dear! Wasn&#8217;t it awful! I did tell her
that very thing, and she said she didn&#8217;t believe
she was hungry either. Then we were
polite to each other till noon. When the
waiter&#8217;s dreaded voice once more rang out, I
made my little speech that I had been composing
all the morning. It was as follows:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t wait for me, Miss Lane. I consider
that over-eating is a heinous fault among
Americans, and so I have decided to omit the
dining-car for the remainder of this journey.
Pray, do not let me keep you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She said, &#8220;Why, that&#8217;s exactly what I
think, too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Just fancy! And there I was almost famished.
I thought she would leave me at
once, and I could have a chance to eat the
luncheon spoiling in my box. Chicken sandwiches
and jelly and olives and salted almonds
and fruit and cake and everything good. I
had been thinking of it for hours.
</p>
<p>What could I do? There she sat, and there
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
I sat in plain sight of each other, being in the
same seat for the sake of sociability, though
her section was the one in front of mine. She
seemed rather quiet and formal&mdash;not so much
stiff as limp, so to speak. Still there was no
cordiality about it. Just as I felt I could not
stand starvation another minute, she rose and
said she believed she would go into the observation-car
for a while. She did not invite me
to accompany her, and I made no offer to go.
I simply sat and smiled and watched her
fumble in her bag for a few minutes before
extricating what was apparently a rolled up
magazine. Then she marched down the aisle.
The instant she had vanished into the vestibule,
I made a dive for my box. In just
thirty seconds I had consumed half a sandwich
and a slice of cake. I kept my eyes on
the spot where she had disappeared, you had
better believe. Oh, wasn&#8217;t I silly? But
then, I promised not to allude to that obvious
fact again. That lunch tasted good. And I
had plenty of time to eat all I wanted, though
I cut short the chewing process.
</p>
<p>When it was all down to the very last olive,
I brushed off all the crumbs I could see, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
decided to walk into the observation car and
be polite again. So I did. And what do you
suppose? Through the glass at the rear I saw
her sitting sort of sidewise so that one eye
could watch the door where I was entering.
It seemed to me that she gave a little quiver
as I came within view, and then actually she
threw something overboard. People always
see more than you think they do. At least I
saw that, and she thought I didn&#8217;t, for when
I emerged upon the platform she looked up
with a surprised smile of welcome and said,
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t the river beautiful!&#8221;
</p>
<p>I said, &#8220;Oh, isn&#8217;t it!&#8221; and then I gazed at
it very hard and attentively so as to give her
a chance to wipe the spot of jelly from her
shirtwaist. She had been eating her luncheon
too. She had carried it wrapped up in the
funneled magazine. She had been ashamed
to acknowledge that she needed to be economical,
too. I saw it all in a flash. She had
intended to ride in the common coach and
save pullman fare, just like me. And there
we had been racing, neck and neck, trying to
keep up with each other.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear!&#8221; I said at last, &#8220;I wish we had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
taken a berth together and saved our two dollars
and a half apiece.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I heard her give a little gasp and I felt her
staring at me. The next minute she said,
&#8220;There are crumbs on your necktie too.&#8221;
And then she bent down her head and laughed
and laughed and laughed till I had to laugh
too.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope it&#8217;ll be a lesson to us,&#8221; I said at
last.
</p>
<p>She wiped the tears from her lashes. &#8220;It
will be. I expect to be repenting for weeks
ahead,&mdash;at least, until my next allowance
comes in. But, you! Why, Miss Leigh, it
seems so queer. I thought the college girl
was different as a rule&mdash;independent and
frank and&mdash;oh, pardon me&mdash;and&mdash;and so
forth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She is,&#8221; I assured her sadly, &#8220;as a rule.
But I am an exception. I prove the rule.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>CONSEQUENCES</h3>
</div>

<p>For her junior year Bea was fortunate
enough to secure a mail-route, the proceeds of
which helped to make her independent of a
home allowance for spending money. To
tell the truth, however, she enjoyed the work
even more than the salary. While distributing
the letters she felt a personal share in
every delighted, &#8220;Oh, thank you!&#8221; in each
ever-unsatisfied, &#8220;Is that all?&#8221; or the disappointed,
&#8220;Nothing for me to-day?&#8221;
</p>
<p>From her own experience and observation
during the years already past, she was particularly
interested in the different pairs of roommates
who came within the scope of her daily
trips. In a certain double lived two freshmen,
one of whom always greeted her with,
&#8220;Oh, thank you!&#8221; whether the mail was addressed
to her or to her roommate. But when
the roommate answered the knock, she invariably
exclaimed, no matter how much was
handed to her, &#8220;Is that all?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></p>
<p>More than once in her reports to Lila, Bea
declared that it was about time for a wave of
reform in the vicinity of Ethelwynne Bruce.
Perhaps she might even have contemplated
the possibility of engineering something of
the kind herself, if she had not been too busy
to spare the necessary thought-energy. In
the course of events, fate with its machinery
of circumstances added an extra lesson to
Ethelwynne&#8217;s college course.
</p>
<p>It happened one evening during the skating
season.
</p>
<p>Ethelwynne with her skates jingling over
her arm came shivering into the room.
&#8220;Oo-oo-ooh!&#8221; Her teeth chattered. &#8220;Wynnie&#8217;s
freezing. Do shut that window and
turn on the heat, Agnes. It is hard lines to
live in a double with a regular Polar bear
direct from the land of Sparta. You ought
to keep it up as high as forty degrees anyhow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sh-h!&#8221; The smooth dark head at the
desk bent lower over the water-color before
her. &#8220;Don&#8217;t interrupt this minute. There&#8217;s
a dear. I&#8217;ve got to catch this last streak of
daylight&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But it isn&#8217;t daylight,&#8221; fretted Ethelwynne,
&#8220;the moon&#8217;s up already. And I&#8217;m so
chilly! I wish you would help me make
some hot chocolate.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at the thermometer. Ah, one more
stroke of that exquisite saffron on the stem!
Hush, now. Look at the thermometer, look
at the thermometer,&#8221; she muttered abstractedly
while concentrating all her mental attention
in the tips of her skilful fingers.
</p>
<p>Ethelwynne stared at her a moment before
giving a little chuckle that ended in a shiver.
&#8220;Look at the thermometer, look at the thermometer,&#8221;
she echoed sarcastically, &#8220;I reckon
that&#8217;ll warm me up, won&#8217;t it? Like somebody
or other who set a lighted candle inside
the fireless stove and then warmed himself at
the glowing isinglass. Suppose your old
thermometer does say seventy or eighty or
ninety or a hundred? Maybe it is telling a
story. Why should I trust an uneducated instrument
that has never studied ethics? Now
listen here!&#8221; She lifted her skates and
poised them to throw from high above her
head. &#8220;Hist! if you don&#8217;t drop those hideous
toadstools of yours and begin to sympathize
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
with me this instant, I shall hur-r-rl
this clanking steel&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agnes still painting busily raised one elbow
in an attitude of half-unconscious defense.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&mdash;&mdash;upon the floor-r-r!&#8221;
</p>
<p>At the crashing rattlety-bang Agnes sprang
to her feet with a nervous shriek. Ethelwynne
dived for her skates and felt them
carefully. &#8220;I tried to pick out the softest
spot on the rug,&#8221; she complained whimsically,
&#8220;but there wasn&#8217;t any other way to wake her
up. And I simply had to have some sympathy.
Oo-oo-ooh, Wynnie&#8217;s freezing!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agnes had returned to her brushes and was
wiping them dry in heartless silence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wynnie&#8217;s freezing, I say.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say it again,&#8221; counseled the other&#8217;s calm
voice. &#8220;I am so provoked at myself for
jumping at every little noise! It is shameful
to have so little control over my own
nerves even if I am tired. Ah! what was
that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jump again,&#8221; advised Ethelwynne in a
tone that was meant to be serene but proved
rather jerky. &#8220;It was nothing but my teeth
chattering and clicking together.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Generally it&#8217;s your tongue,&#8221; retorted
Agnes with interest but broke off in this
promising repartee to exclaim with genuine
anxiety, &#8220;Why, Wynnie, child, you have a
regular chill. Lie down quick and let me
cover you up. Have you been out skating
ever since I left you on the lake?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I have,&#8221; she replied with an air of
defiance, &#8220;you needn&#8217;t preach. I couldn&#8217;t
bear to come in. Everybody out. We had
square dances, shinney-on-the-ice, wood tag.
Perfectly glorious! Such a splendid elegant
sunset behind the bare trees! I simply had
to stay. Beatrice Leigh and her crowd were
there. A big moon came sailing up. We
skated to music&mdash;somebody whistled it. I
couldn&#8217;t bear to stop. I wanted to stay, I tell
you. I wanted to stay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hm-m,&#8221; said Agnes, &#8220;I wanted to stay
too. But what with the Latin test to-morrow
and this plate for the book on fungi to be sent
off in the morning, I managed to tear myself
away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re different. Oo-oo-ooh!&#8221; Ethelwynne
shivered violently again. &#8220;You like
to deny yourself. You enjoy discipline. It
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
gives you pleasure to do what you hate. You
love duty just because it is disagreeable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My&mdash;land!&#8221; Agnes clutched her own
head. &#8220;The infant must have slipped up a
dozen times too often. Did the horrid bad ice
smite her at the base of the brain? Poor little
darling! Is her intellect all mixedy-muddle-y?
We will fix it right for her. We&#8217;ll
give her a pill.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I have caught cold,&#8221; moaned her
roommate from the depths of the blankets.
</p>
<p>Agnes looked judicial. &#8220;Our doctor at
home has a theory that people take cold easily
when they have been eating too much sweet
stuff. He says that colds are most frequent
after Thanksgiving. Now I wonder&mdash;I believe&mdash;why,
you surely did go to a meeting of
the fudge-club in Martha&#8217;s room last night.
Ethelwynne, did you eat it? Did you eat it
even after all the doctor said to you about your
sick headaches?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I ate it. How do you expect
me to sit hungry in a roomful of girls all digging
into that plateful of brown delicious soft
hot fudge with their little silver spoons, and I
not even tasting it? I hated to make myself
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
conspicuous before the juniors there. They
would think I am a hypochondriac, and Berta
Abbott might have said something to make
the others look at me and laugh. I don&#8217;t believe
the stuff hurts me a particle. Doctors
always want you to give up the things you
like best.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Ethelwynne!&#8221; groaned Agnes, &#8220;you
never deny yourself anything. It is the only
trait I don&#8217;t like in you. Now you have
caught a dreadful cold just because you could
not refuse the candy. You must break it up
with quinine.&#8221; She fetched a small box from
the bureau in her bedroom. &#8220;Here, open
your mouth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The other girl opened her mouth obediently.
&#8220;I love pills. We&#8217;re homeopaths, you know.
Once when I was a baby, I got hold of
mother&#8217;s medicine chest and ate all the pellets.
I thought they were candy. Sweet&mdash;oh,
delicious! I used to enjoy being sick.
And now this nice big chocolate-coated pill!&#8221;
She sprang up suddenly, her face twisted into
an expression of agony. &#8220;Oh, oh, oh!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agnes white as a sheet flew to her side.
&#8220;What is it? Quick, quick, Wynnie! Is it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
your heart? Your head? A darting pain!
Where, oh, where?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Crackie!&#8221; Ethelwynne ruefully rubbed
her mouth. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been sucking that pill.&#8221;
</p>
<p>After a moment&#8217;s struggle to retain her
sympathetic gravity, Agnes gave way and
dropping her head on her hands shook alarmingly
for at least half a minute.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you I was a homeopath,&#8221; expostulated
Ethelwynne, &#8220;how was I to know that
allopaths always swallow their pills whole?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wh-wh-why did you suppose it was coated
with chocolate?&#8221; gasped Agnes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So as to improve the taste of course and
tempt me to eat it. I am fond of chocolate.
If it is my duty to eat a pill, I want it to be
inviting. I don&#8217;t want to do anything that I
don&#8217;t want to do, specially when I am sick.
Well, anyhow, I shall never touch another.&#8221;
</p>
<p>However, by bedtime Ethelwynne was feeling
so miserable that finally after long urging she
consented to swallow another dose of quinine
in the orthodox way. She allowed Agnes to
put a hot water bottle at her feet and to tuck
in the coverlets cozily; and then she tried to
go to sleep. But that was another story. It
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
was a story of fitful jerks and starts, of burning
fever alternating with shivering spells, of
terrifying dreams and wretched haunted hours
of wakefulness. At last the longed-for morning
stole in at the windows to find her eyes
heavy, her limbs languid, her brain muddled
and dull, her head roaring.
</p>
<p>It was the quinine that had done it&mdash;she
knew it was&mdash;unspeakably worse than the
cold unattended. Worried Agnes acknowledged
that the dose might effect some systems
violently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But it has broken up your cold,&#8221; she
pleaded, &#8220;that&#8217;s certainly gone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; said Ethelwynne fretfully, &#8220;don&#8217;t
mumble so and run your words together. I
can&#8217;t hear the gong very well either. And
the Latin test is coming the first hour after
breakfast. I haven&#8217;t had a chance to review
an ode. I feel so wretched! Oh, me! oh,
me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ethelwynne never forgot that Latin test.
The very first line written by the instructor
on the blackboard smote her with despair.
She had never been able to translate from
hearing anyhow. This morning when Miss
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
Sawyer took her seat on the platform and
opened her book, Ethelwynne bent forward
anxiously, every nerve alert and strained.
What was the first word? Oh, what was it?
She had not caught it. It sounded blurred
and mazy with no ending at all. And the
next&mdash;and the next! And the third! Now
she had lost it. The first was gone. She had
forgotten the second. The voice went reading
on and on. She floundered after, falling
farther and farther behind. There wasn&#8217;t any
sense to it, and she couldn&#8217;t hear the words
plainly, and everything was all mixed up.
The other girls seemed to understand. They
were writing down the translation as fast as
they could scribble&mdash;at least some of them
were. But she could not make out a particle
of meaning. It was Agnes&#8217;s fault&mdash;it was all
her fault. She had coaxed her to take the
quinine, and now she could not hear plainly
or think or remember or anything.
</p>
<p>In wrathful discouragement she turned to
the rest of the questions. One or two were
short and easy. She managed to do the translations
already familiar. But when she
reached the last part and attempted to write
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
down an ode which she had memorized the
week before, she found that many of the words
had slipped away from her. The opening line
was vivid enough, then came a blank ending
in a phrase that kept dancing trickily from
spot to spot in her visual imagination of the
page. Here she recalled two words, there
three, with a vanishing, vague, intangible
verse between. The meaning had slid away
utterly, leaving only these faulty mechanical
impressions of the way the poem had looked
in print. Struggle as she would, the thought
frolicked and pranced just beyond the grasp
of her memory.
</p>
<p>Ethelwynne bit her lip grimly and put the
cap on her fountain-pen. It was not the
slightest use. Miss Sawyer had always told
them to learn the odes understandingly, not
in parrot fashion. It was better to submit a
blank than a paper scribbled with detached
words and phrases. It was all Agnes&#8217;s fault&mdash;every
bit. She had forced her to swallow
that pill&mdash;the pill that had muddled her brain
and dulled her hearing&mdash;the pill which was
causing her to flunk in Latin. She had known
that ode perfectly only the previous day. It
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
wasn&#8217;t her fault&mdash;it was entirely Agnes&#8217;s. She
would go instantly and tell her so.
</p>
<p>And she went the moment class was over.
To be sure, she did not go so fast as she wished,
for her head had a queer way of spinning dizzily
at every sudden movement. Once or
twice her knees faltered disconcertingly in her
progress down the corridor. But at last she
reached the room and walked in with a backward
slam of the door.
</p>
<p>Agnes was putting the final touches to the
water-color drawing of exquisite fungi before
her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sh-h,&#8221; she murmured, &#8220;don&#8217;t interrupt.
Just one more stroke&mdash;and another&mdash;now this
tiny one. There, it is finished. Professor
Stratton sends her manuscript off to-day and
she is waiting for this. Think of it! Thirty
dollars for this sheet of paper! Thirty whole
big beautiful dollars to send home for Christmas.
They need it pretty badly. I&#8217;ve worked
hours and hours, and now they shall have a
real Christmas! I know what mother wants
and couldn&#8217;t afford&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ethelwynne stamped her foot. &#8220;It was all
your fault. I couldn&#8217;t hear. I couldn&#8217;t think.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
I couldn&#8217;t remember. The pill did it. You
made me take it. You always think you know
best. You&#8217;re always preaching and advising.
You wanted to make me flunk. You knew
it would make my ears ring and my head
whirl. You did it on purpose. I shall never
forgive you, never, never, never!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221;
</p>
<p>At the tone Ethelwynne suddenly shivered,
threw herself on the couch, and fell to crying
weakly. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean it. I didn&#8217;t mean
it at all. I only wanted to say something horrid.
I wanted you to suffer too. I just wanted
to say it, and so I did say it. Oh, oh, oh, I
am so miserable! I want to go home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agnes paid no attention. In her sudden
sharp resentment at the preposterous accusation,
she had swung around in her chair, and
her elbow had tipped over the inkwell, spilling
the contents over the desk. She sat staring
in horrified silence at her ruined drawing.
</p>
<p>Finally Ethelwynne puzzled by the continued
stillness peered with one eye from the
sheltering fringes. She sprang up with a
jump.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Agnes, your beautiful fungi!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span></p>
<p>A knock sounded at the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; called Agnes in mechanical response.
There was a pause; then the knob
turned and the visitor entered with diffident
step.
</p>
<p>Ethelwynne hastily smoothed her hair with
one hand and felt of her belt with the other.
&#8220;Oh, good evening, Professor Stratton,&#8221; she
stuttered from surprised embarrassment, &#8220;I
mean, good morning. How do you do?
Won&#8217;t you sit down?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agnes turned to look, and rose in sober
greeting.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You see it is spoiled,&#8221; she pointed to the
ink-splotched drawing. &#8220;It was an accident.
You don&#8217;t know how exceedingly sorry I am,
Professor Stratton. The work on your book
can go on without it, I hope.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The older woman forgot her incorrigible
shyness in dismay. &#8220;What a shame! How
distressing!&#8221; She hurried forward impulsively
to examine the sheet. &#8220;Since you
brought it to me last night I have been exulting
in the thought of it. You have great
talent for such work. The time you have
spent on it! How distressing!&#8221; She stopped
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
in thoughtful fear that she might be adding
to the girl&#8217;s disappointment. &#8220;An accident,
you say? How did it happen?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Something startled me so that I twirled
around in my seat, and my elbow knocked
the ink over. I&mdash;I am very sorry.&#8221; Her
lips felt stiff. Ethelwynne watching with
miserable eyes saw her moisten them. They
were drooping at the corners.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is my fault,&#8221; she burst out hurriedly,
&#8220;it is all my fault. I made her jump. I
startled her on purpose. I said mean things
to her because I felt like saying them. I felt
like saying them because I had flunked in
Latin. And I flunked in Latin because I took
a p-p-pill&mdash;oh, no, no! I mean, because I
caught cold from staying out on the ice
too long. And I stayed out long because I
wanted to. And the reason why I caught
cold from staying out too long was because
my digestion was upset from eating fudge
when the doctor told me not to. And I ate
the fudge because I wanted it. And it is all
my fault. It is all because I do things just
because I want to do them and not because I
ought to do them or ought not to do them. I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
ought to leave them undone, you know. And
Prexie says that most miseries in life come
from that attitude of I-do-it-because-I-want-to-do-it-and-
I-don&#8217;t-do-it-because-I-don&#8217;t-want-to-do-it.
And now Agnes won&#8217;t have thirty
dollars to send home for Christmas. And it
is all my&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; said Agnes, &#8220;hush, now, dear!
That&#8217;ll be all right. It was my fault anyhow.
I should have had better control of my nerves
and learned not to let myself get startled.&#8221;
She smiled reassuringly across the bowed head
into Professor Stratton&#8217;s concerned eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will see what I can do about holding
back the manuscript till you reproduce the
drawing,&#8221; said the older woman, &#8220;it is barely
possible that I can manage it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As the door closed softly behind her,
Ethelwynne lifted her tear-wet face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Agnes, do you think it was the pill that
did it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did what? Everything?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, no! Was it the pill that made
me flunk in Latin?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she answered doubtfully,
&#8220;perhaps it helped.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I want to say it was the pill. I want to believe
it was the pill. I want to, but I won&#8217;t,
because it wasn&#8217;t&mdash;not really way down underneath
truly, you know. It was my own
selfish self.&#8221; She reached up both arms to
draw Agnes closer in a repentant hug.
&#8220;Wynnie&#8217;s sorry,&#8221; she said.

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>A GIRL TO HAVE FRIENDS</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Laura!&#8221; It was a soft little call sent
fluttering in through the keyhole. &#8220;Laura,
are you there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Laura with her chin propped on her hands
at one of the broad sills stirred uneasily in her
chair and glanced sideways at her roommate
who was seated before the other window.
Lucine had stopped reading aloud and was
regarding the door with an irritable frown on
her vivid dark face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do wish, Laura, that you would tell
Berta Abbott that an engaged sign on our
door means nothing if not the desire for undisturbed
privacy. She is the most inconsiderate
person in the junior class. This is the
third time&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Laura!&#8221; called the voice again, &#8220;answer
me! I know you are in there. I&#8217;ve simply
got to speak to you one minute. It&#8217;s awfully
important.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span></p>
<p>Laura half rose with a pleading smile toward
Lucine who motioned her indignantly
back to her seat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Laura Wallace, stay right there. You
promised to help me revise this essay. You
know that I can&#8217;t do it alone, because I
haven&#8217;t a particle of critical ability; and the
editors say they cannot print it as it is now.
You are exceedingly selfish to think of deserting
me just when I most need your suggestions.
The board of editors meets to-night to
choose the material for the next number of
the magazine, and if they decline this again I
shan&#8217;t be eligible for election next month.
You promised.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Laura, there&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve got to ask
you. If you don&#8217;t come out, I shall have to
take this sign down and walk in my own self.
Laura! Ah!&#8221; The door swung open and tall
Berta popped in. Slamming it behind her, she
stood with both hands on the knob, her eyes
fixed with an expression of innocent inquiry
upon Lucine who had halted in the middle of
her sudden dash across the floor, her hand
still outstretched toward the key.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me, Miss Brett. Were you just going
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
out? I&#8217;m glad I did not disturb you.
Shall I hold it open for you?&#8221; She stepped
to one side and waited gravely without moving
a muscle till Lucine after a withering stare had
stalked angrily back to her window. The
corner of Berta&#8217;s mouth gave a quick, queer
little twitch before settling back into proper
solemnity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, Laura. You&#8217;d better. I shan&#8217;t
keep you long.&#8221; At her imperious gesture
Laura slid out of the room at an apologetic
angle, her head twisted for a final shy glance
back at Lucine who was apparently absorbed
in her papers.
</p>
<p>When safely outside in the corridor Berta
seized her about the waist and whirled her
away from all possible earshot through cracks
and transom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now then, exit the ogre, or rather eximus
nos, leaving the ogre alone. For what particular
reason is she trampling all over you to-day?
I didn&#8217;t catch all her last speech. You
don&#8217;t mean to say that you have promised to
help her with her writing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Laura nodded her rough curly head.
She was a delicate little thing with the irregular
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
features that generally accompany such
hair. Her beauty lay in her expression which
brightened charmingly from minute to minute
since her escape. &#8220;Oh, how good the air
smells!&#8221; she stopped to lean from an open
window. &#8220;Lucine shivers at every draught.
It is hard to manage the ventilation to suit two
persons in the same room. I smother&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you smother&mdash;and you smother
a good many more hours than she shivers.
Trust her for that. Such a little ninny as you
are! Don&#8217;t forget that you have agreed to
room with my best little sister when she
enters next fall. You would not have been
thrust in with Lucine Brett this year if I
could have prevented it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but if I can&#8217;t come back&mdash;you know,
I&#8217;m almost sure I shan&#8217;t come back. And
anyhow I&#8217;m the only friend she has. I&#8217;ve got
to stick to her. If you could hear her mourning
over her loneliness! Nobody cares for
her&mdash;nobody in all the world! And the girls
don&#8217;t like her. I promised to be her friend.
She&mdash;she needs me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; growled Berta sourly, but
somehow her arm was stealing around the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
slight shoulders so far beneath her own, &#8220;that&#8217;s
the silly kind of a person you are. If any
creature needs you, from a lame kitten to a
lion with a toothache, you&#8217;ll cling. Idiocy,
that&#8217;s what it is! Your brother warned me
last summer to restrict your charities. And
now to help her with her writing, and she
your most dangerous rival for the editorship!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, but she doesn&#8217;t know it, you understand.
She doesn&#8217;t know that I am eligible.
The editors have been so awfully kind to me
and gave me book reviews to do and reports
to make, and they printed my verses and two
editorials. Every freshman who has had so
many words published is eligible for election
on the board at their annual meeting next
month. Lucine&#8217;s last story was clipped so
much that she is short about two thousand
words; and this is her last chance to qualify
by getting her essay accepted for the next
issue. I&#8217;ve got to help.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, certainly you&#8217;ve got to help a rival
qualify for a competition in which she is
likely to defeat you. Do you realize that?&#8221;
Berta swung Laura around in front of her and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
studied her curiously while she spoke. &#8220;You
are a good steady worker, you understand.
You have critical ability and a simple,
sincere style. If elected you would make an
excellent editor, but&mdash;now listen, but, I say,
you are not a genius like Lucine Brett. She
is brilliant. Oh, I acknowledge that, even if
I do despise her for being selfish and disagreeable
and ego&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush! She tries&mdash;she doesn&#8217;t understand&mdash;&mdash;You
mustn&#8217;t talk that way. I
won&#8217;t listen. I promised to be her friend.
She wonders why the girls don&#8217;t like her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet she expects you to help her defeat
you! She is willing to accept that sacrifice
from you! When it means so much to
you that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, hush, Berta!&#8221; Laura slipped out of
the range of that keen straight-ahead gaze and
nestled under the protecting arm again.
&#8220;She doesn&#8217;t know that I am eligible, I tell
you. My articles weren&#8217;t signed usually except
with initials. And she is not thinking
about other girls&#8217; qualifications&mdash;she&#8217;s bothered
about her own. It&#8217;s got to be a fair race
with everybody in it, if they want to be. Of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
course she will be elected&mdash;there isn&#8217;t a doubt&mdash;and
I&#8217;ll be as glad as any one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221; Berta&#8217;s voice veered from sarcasm
to genuine anxiety. &#8220;You&#8217;ll be glad&mdash;but
you&#8217;ll be glad at home. You can&#8217;t come back
to college&mdash;you told me so yourself&mdash;unless
you are elected editor. That&#8217;s why I called
you out just now. Did your uncle really say
that he was disappointed in your career here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Laura cleared her throat. &#8220;He doesn&#8217;t
like it because I haven&#8217;t won any honors yet.
Don&#8217;t you know how almost every girl here
came from a school where she was the brightest
star and carried off all the prizes and
things like that? My uncle doesn&#8217;t understand.
He thinks it is the fault of the college
because I haven&#8217;t done anything great.
Oh, you know, Berta. I&mdash;I do hate to talk in
such a conceited way. He doesn&#8217;t realize
that I am not brighter than the rest and can&#8217;t
dazzle. He wants me to win an honor that
he can put in the papers at home. He says if
I don&#8217;t distinguish myself this year, I might
as well stop and go to the Normal next
fall. He thinks college is too expensive.
This editorship is the only chance, because&mdash;because
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
there isn&#8217;t anything else for our class
now that the offices are filled and committees
appointed. He didn&#8217;t like it because my articles
in the magazine were signed with initials
and not the whole name. He said, &#8216;Well,
niece Laura, let me see your name printed
plain in that list of editors, and then we&#8217;ll
decide about next year.&#8217; He&mdash;he&#8217;s disappointed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet,&#8221; Berta spoke slowly, &#8220;you are
going to help Lucine Brett with that essay.
And you know how much my little sister
cares about being at college with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Laura gave a startled jump and turned to
run. &#8220;Oh, Berta, I had forgotten. She&#8217;s
waiting. I&#8217;ve stayed too long. She&#8217;ll be so
angry!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let her,&#8221; growled Berta; but Laura had
fled.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile Lucine when left alone had
dropped the sheets of her essay in her lap and
planting her elbows on the sill crouched forward,
staring miserably out at the brown
soaked lawn flecked with sodden snowdrifts in
the shadows of the evergreens that were bending
before a rollicking March wind.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody cares,&#8221; she mourned, &#8220;even Laura
doesn&#8217;t care whether I succeed or not. I want
the girls to like me, but they won&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tears of self-pity dimmed her lashes when
Laura slipped timidly into the room and after
a worried glance at the scattered papers resumed
her former seat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Lucine, if you will read that last
paragraph once more, I will try to see where
the difficulty lies. It&mdash;it&#8217;s fine so far.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lucine looked down at her essay, then
across at the attentive small face that appeared
quite plain when fixed in such a worried
pucker. &#8220;No,&#8221; she said at last, &#8220;I won&#8217;t.
You are not interested in the essay or in my
hopes of success. You offer to help merely
because you think it is your duty. I refuse to
accept such grudging friendship. You toss
aside my affairs at the slightest whim of an
outsider, and then expect me to welcome the
remnant of your mental powers. No, thank
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Laura bit her lip. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;you ought not to feel that way about it. I
do truly wish to help you all I can. Please!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lucine made a half-involuntary movement
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
to gather up the sheets; then checked herself.
&#8220;No, I have too much pride to play second
fiddle. Your neglect has wounded me deeply,
and I do not see how I can ever forgive you.
To forsake me for such a shallow, disagreeable
person as Berta Abbott is an unpardonable
insult.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Laura gave a little shiver and lifted her head
sharply. &#8220;I have tried to be your friend. I
have endured&mdash;things. But I won&#8217;t endure
this&mdash;I won&#8217;t&mdash;I can&#8217;t. Berta is my friend.
You shall not speak of her like that to me.
Say you&#8217;re sorry&mdash;quick! Oh, Lucine, say
you didn&#8217;t mean it and are sorry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not sorry,&#8221; said Lucine distinctly,
&#8220;and I did mean it. I am glad I have dared
to speak the truth about her. She is shallow
and disagreeable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And what are you?&#8221; Laura sprang to
her feet. &#8220;A conceited selfish inconsiderate&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
She clapped her hand to her
mouth with a quick sobbing breath. &#8220;Oh,
Lucine, we can&#8217;t be friends. I&#8217;ve tried and
tried, but we can&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p>From beneath lowered eyelids Lucine
watched the slight little figure hurry to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
door and vanish. Then rising abruptly she
jerked a chair in front of her desk, slapped
down a fresh pad of paper, jabbed her pen
into the inkwell, shook it fiercely over the
blotter&mdash;and suddenly brushing the pages
hither and thither she flung out her arms
upon them and buried her face from the light.
</p>
<p>A few minutes later Laura entered noiselessly
and stopped short at sight of the crouching
form with shoulders that rose and fell
over a long quivering sob. Laura took one
step toward her, next two away; finally setting
her teeth resolutely she glided softly
across the room and patted the bent, dark
head. For an instant Lucine lay motionless;
then with a swift hungry gesture she reached
out her arms and swept the younger girl
close to her heart.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Laura, I can&#8217;t spare you, I can&#8217;t spare
you. You are all I have. Forgive me and
let me try again. It is an evil spirit that
made me talk that way. And, oh, Laura,
dear, I want you to like me better than you
like Berta. I need you more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Laura put up her mouth in child-fashion
for a kiss of reconciliation. &#8220;I like you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
both,&#8221; she said, and freeing herself gently
stooped to pick up the loose leaves of the
essay. &#8220;Shall we go on with revising this
now, Lucine? It is due this evening, you
know. The board meets at eight in the magazine
sanctum.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lucine watched her with a wistfulness that
softened to tenderness the faint lines of native
selfishness about her mouth. &#8220;Laura, I want
you to room with me next year. We can
choose a double with a study and adjoining
bedrooms. It will make me so happy. Do
you know, last autumn when I lived in the
main building and you away off in the farthest
dormitory, I used to sit in a corridor window
every morning to watch for you. I care more
for you than for any one else. I shall teach
you to care most for me next year.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Laura seemed to have extraordinary trouble
in capturing the last sheet, for it fluttered
away repeatedly from her grasp and she kept
bending to reach it again. Lucine could not
see her face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you,&#8221; she repeated, &#8220;will you room
with me next year, Laura?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Laura coughed and made another wild dive
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
in pursuit of the incorrigible paper. &#8220;Let&#8217;s
not talk about next year,&#8221; she mumbled uncomfortably,
&#8220;it is so far off and ever so
many things may happen before June. Of
course,&#8221; she faltered and swallowed something
in her throat, &#8220;I&#8217;d love to room with you, if&mdash;if
I can. But now we must hurry with this
essay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, remember that I have asked you
first,&#8221; said Lucine, &#8220;and I can&#8217;t spare you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Laura said nothing.
</p>
<p>After the essay had been read and discussed
by Laura whose critical insight was much
keener than Lucine&#8217;s, the older girl settled
herself to rewrite the article before evening.
Dinner found her still at her desk, fingers
inky, hair disordered, collar loosened in the
fury of composition. In reply to Laura&#8217;s
urgent summons to dress, she paused long
enough to push back a lock that had fallen
over her brow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bother me now. I&#8217;m just getting
this right at last. Go away. I don&#8217;t want
any dinner.&#8221; The pen began again on its
busy scratching.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lucine, you know the doctor warned you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
to be more regular about eating. Whenever
you work so intensely, you always pay for it
in exhaustion the next day. Do come now
and finish the essay later.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The rumpled head bent still lower. &#8220;I
wouldn&#8217;t drop this now for thirty dinners or
suppers. It&#8217;s good&mdash;it&#8217;s fine&mdash;it&#8217;s bound to be
accepted&mdash;it means the editorship. To sacrifice
it for dinner! Do go away. I wish you
would leave me alone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Laura turned away silently. If the success
of the article was in question, she certainly
could not interfere further. Lucine wrote on,
paying no heed to the gong except for the
tribute of an impatient frown at the sound of
many feet clicking past in the corridor, with
a rustling of skirts and light chat of voices.
At seven when the bell for chapel again filled
the halls with murmur and movement, she
only shrugged uneasily and scribbled faster.
By half-past she had finished and was re-reading
it for final corrections. Then folding it
with a smile of weary contentment, for at last
she knew that it was sure of success, she set
out to carry it to the magazine sanctum.
</p>
<p>Down the stairs and through the lower corridor
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
she hastened toward the plain wooden
door whose key she hoped next year to claim
for her own fingers. The transom shone dark,
and no voice yet disturbed the quiet of the
neighborhood. Evidently the editorial board
had not yet begun to assemble for the business
session. Lucine decided to wait till they arrived,
so as to be certain that the precious essay
reached their hands in safety. If she
should drop it through the letter slit in the
door, it might be overlooked.
</p>
<p>Curling up on a window ledge in a shadowy
corner behind a wardrobe she waited while
dreamily gazing at the moon which was sailing
through clouds tossed by the still rollicking
wind. Ever since her first glimpse of the
magazine&#8217;s brown covers, she had determined
to become editor-in-chief some time. Now this
essay would surely be accepted, and when
printed this month would render her eligible
for election as the first sophomore editor.
From that position she would advance to the
literary editorship next year, and then to be
chief of the staff when she was a senior. Then&mdash;ah,
then the girls would be eager and proud
to be friends with her. And Laura would be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
glad she had not forsaken her in her early
struggles. So far she had been too busy with
her writing to make friends and keep them.
It took so much time and was such a bother
to be friendly and do favors all the while.
But by and by she would have leisure to
grow unselfish and show the girls how noble
and charming and altogether delightful she
could be&mdash;by and by. Meanwhile her work
came first. She simply had to succeed in winning
this editorship.
</p>
<p>While Lucine lingered there, leaning her
forehead against the cool pane, footsteps
sounded from around the transverse; and two
figures, arm in arm, strolled nearer. They
glanced at the dusky transom, laughed over
the tardiness of their stern editor-in-chief, and
sat down on a convenient box to wait.
</p>
<p>Lucine after an intent scrutiny to identify
the two seniors as subordinate editors turned
again to the moon, and listened half unconsciously
to the low trickle of words till suddenly
her own name roused her alert.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they&#8217;re the favorite candidates.&#8221; It
was Bea&#8217;s voice that spoke. &#8220;If Miss Brett
completes her quota of lines this month she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
will undoubtedly have the best chance in the
election, even if she is personally unpopular.
She is exceedingly self-centred, you know,
and does not trouble herself even to appear
interested in anybody else. Her manner
is unfortunate. However she is unquestionably
the ablest writer in the class though
little Laura Wallace is a close second. Berta
knew her at home and is very fond of her.
Laura and Berta&#8217;s sister Harriet have always
been special friends.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Laura eligible? I do think she is the
sweetest child!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you know it? Her work has been
mainly inconspicuous contributions signed
only with initials. Stuff like that counts up
amazingly in the long run. She is a better
critic though not so original as Miss Brett.
For my part I think the editor-in-chief ought
to be primarily a critic, but perhaps I am
wrong. Anyhow the theory is that the election
goes to the best writer. I&#8217;m sorry. I
half wish Miss Brett would fail to qualify.
The editorship means such a heap to Laura.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Her uncle who pays her expenses here is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
rather queer&mdash;thinks he ought to see more results
of her career. He&#8217;s disappointed because
she doesn&#8217;t gather in prizes as she did in the
country schools. She may in her senior year,
but freshmen don&#8217;t have much chance to win
anything more than an honorable record.
He doesn&#8217;t believe in college anyhow and consented
to send her under protest. Now he
threatens to stop it if she doesn&#8217;t do something
dazzling this year.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor infant! What a ridiculous attitude!
But since that is the case, why not vote her
in? Lay the circumstances before the board,
and they&#8217;ll elect her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, they won&#8217;t. The board is altogether
too scrupulous and idealistic this season
to let personal feelings interfere. You&#8217;re
rather new to office as yet. Mark my words
and trust me: if Miss Brett qualifies, she will
be elected. I know&mdash;and that&#8217;s why I wish
she wouldn&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There come the others. See that pile of
manuscript. We&#8217;ll be lucky if we get away
at midnight. I only hope nobody will ask
me to compose a poem to fill out a page; my
head feels as if stuffed with sawdust.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></p>
<p>Lucine turned her head slowly to watch the
group of girls wander into the office and light
the gas amid a flutter of papers and dressing-gowns
mixed with sleepy yawns and tired
laughter. Then some one shut the door.
Lucine was still sitting in the shadowy window-seat,
her essay clutched tightly in her hand.
</p>
<p>After a minute she rose, walked toward the
door, and lifted her arm as if to knock. Then
giving herself an impatient shake she swung
around and hurried down the corridor as far
as the transverse. There she hesitated, halted,
half swerved to retrace her steps, stamped one
foot down hard, brought up the other beside
it, and clenching both fists over the essay fled
from the neighborhood.
</p>
<p>When she reached her room, she paused to
listen. Hearing no sound she slipped inside,
threw the essay into a drawer, locked it, and
put the key in her pocket. Then after a
wistful glance around she stooped to pick up
Laura&#8217;s white tam from the couch, pressed it
against her cheek for a moment, and laid it
gently in the empty little chair where Laura
had sat while listening to the essay that afternoon.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Laura,&#8221; she whispered, &#8220;I can&#8217;t spare
you, Laura. You shall come back next year,
and we shall room together again, you and I.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Without a backward look toward the
drawer where the manuscript lay buried,
Lucine gathered up note-book and fountain-pen
and departed for the library. She walked
slowly through the long apartment, glancing
into alcove after alcove only to find every
chair occupied on both sides of the polished
tables that gleamed softly in the gaslight.
Finally she discovered one of the small movable
steps that were used when a girl wished
to reach the highest shelf. Capturing it she
carried it to the farther end of a narrow recess
between two bookcases and doubled her
angular length into a cozy heap for an evening
with Shelley&#8217;s poem of &#8220;Prometheus Unbound.&#8221;
That was to be the English lesson
for the next day.
</p>
<p>As she read verse after verse, the music of
the wonderful lines soothed her restless mood,
and the beauty of the thought that love and
forgiveness are stronger than selfishness lifted
her to a height of joyous exaltation. The
idea of Prometheus suffering all agonies for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
the sake of men came to her like a revelation.
While she pondered over it, suddenly like the
shining of a great light she understood the
truth of &#8220;he that loseth his soul shall find it.&#8221;
The Christ-ideal of self-sacrifice meant the
highest self-realization.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My cup runneth over, my cup runneth
over,&#8221; sang Lucine in her heart, as she read
on and on. &#8220;I have been blind but now I
see. It has been always true, always, always.
My cup runneth over. Listen:
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;&#8216;It doth repent me; words are quick and vain;</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>Grief for awhile is blind, and so was mine,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>I wish no living thing to suffer pain.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>&#8220;Laura!&#8221; Lucine raised her head dreamily.
She was unconscious of how the evening
hours had drifted past, leaving only a few
lingering students here and there in the
library. She could not see the two girls bending
over the table on the other side of the
bookcase behind which she was nestling.
But their voices floated mistily to her ears.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Laura, remember that you have promised
to live with my sister next year. Don&#8217;t let
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
Lucine coax or frighten you out of it. You
have promised.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But if I don&#8217;t come back?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, anyway you have promised to room
with Harriet if you do. We&#8217;ll choose a parlor
away off at the other end of the campus
from Lucine, so that I can protect you from
her demands. You&#8217;ve been growing thinner
and whiter all the year. Now, remember.
Don&#8217;t you give in to her selfishness. She is
able to take care of her precious self without
killing you in the process. Promise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lucine heard a sigh. &#8220;I&#8217;ve promised to be
her friend and I do care for her dearly; but I
want with all my heart to room with Harriet,
if I can manage to get back for next year.
I&#8217;m almost sure I shan&#8217;t. Now, see here, does
this verb come from vinco or vincio? I&#8217;m so
sleepy I can&#8217;t read straight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lucine very white about the lips was sitting
erect in her corner. &#8220;My cup runneth
over, my cup runneth over,&#8221; echoed faintly in
her brain. &#8220;My cup runneth over and Laura
likes her best and the essay is up-stairs and I
wish no living thing to suffer pain&mdash;suffer
pain. My cup runneth over. &#8216;Pain, pain
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
ever, forever!&#8217; I won&#8217;t, I won&#8217;t, I can&#8217;t
do it, I can&#8217;t, I can&#8217;t, I can&#8217;t! To sacrifice
it all for her and then&mdash;and then to be forsaken!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lucine glided from the recess, passed
swiftly from the library, climbed the stairs to
her room, moved toward the drawer which
held the essay, and felt for the key in her
pocket. It was gone. It must have fallen
out while she read, doubled up on the low
step. In wild haste now, for the minutes
were flying and the board of editors might
even now have adjourned, she hurried back to
search. The green baize doors swung open in
her face, and Berta and Laura came loitering
out, their arms around each other, their heads
bent close together affectionately.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lucine, oh, Lucine!&#8221; Laura at sight of
her slipped away from Berta, &#8220;what is the
matter? What has happened? Didn&#8217;t they
accept the essay?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Brushing her aside Lucine swept on into
the library, turned into the recess, and
dropped on her knees beside the step to look
for the stray key. Her eyes fell upon the
open book which lay face downward where
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
she had forgotten it. Then she remembered.
&#8220;I wish no living thing to suffer pain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was long past ten o&#8217;clock and the corridors
stretched out their dusky deserted
length from one dim gas-jet to another flickering
in the shadows, when Lucine crept back
to her room. Laura raised a wide-eyed anxious
face from the white pillow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lucine, I couldn&#8217;t sleep until I knew.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The older girl sat down on the bed and
drew the little figure close.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When you are editor, Laura, will you try
to like me still? And will you keep on forgiving
me and helping&mdash;helping me to deserve
to have friends? And will you&mdash;will
you teach me how to make Harriet like me
too?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Lucine!&#8221; Laura flung her warm
arms around the bowed neck. &#8220;I know what
we shall do next year, if I can come back.
The idea has just struck me. You and Harriet
and I shall room together in a firewall
with bedrooms for three!&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>AN ORIGINAL IN MATH</h3>
</div>

<p>When Gertrude&#8217;s brother turned up at
college just before the holidays of their senior
year, he boldly asked for Bea in the same
breath with his sister&#8217;s name. When the
message was brought to her, that fancy-free
young person&#8217;s first thought was a quick dread
that Berta would tease her about the preference.
But no. Miss Abbott, chairman of the
Annual&#8217;s editorial board, clasped her inky
hands in relief.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless the boy! He couldn&#8217;t have chosen
better if he had looked through the walls and
discovered Bea the sole student with time to
burn&mdash;or to talk, for that matter. Trot along,
Beatrice, and tell him that Gertrude is coming
the moment she has dug her way out of
this avalanche of manuscript. I can&#8217;t possibly
spare her for half an hour yet. Go and distract
his mind from his unnatural sister by
means of another story.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Tell him about your little original in
math, Bea,&#8221; called Lila after her, &#8220;that&#8217;s
your best and latest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bea retraced her steps to thrust back an injured
countenance at the door. &#8220;I guess I
am able to converse as well as monologue,
can&#8217;t I?&#8221; she demanded indignantly, &#8220;you
just listen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>However, when confronted by a young man
with a monosyllabic tongue and an embarrassingly
eloquent pair of eyes, she seized a copy
of the last Annual from the table in the
senior parlor, and plunged into an account of
her own editorial trials.
</p>
<p>Gertrude is on the board for this year&#8217;s
Annual, you know, and Berta Abbott is chairman.
At this very moment they are struggling
over a deluge of manuscripts submitted
in their prize poem contest. Of course, I
sympathize, because I have been through
something of the same ordeal. The Monthly
offered a prize for a short story last fall, and
we had rather a lively sequel to the decision.
Shall I tell you about it from the beginning?
At our special meeting, I read the stories
aloud, because I happen to be chief editor.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
Nobody said anything at first. Janet, the
business editor, tipped her chair back and
stared at the piles of magazines on the shelves
opposite. Laura, who does the locals, pressed
her forehead closer to the pane to watch the
girls hurrying past on their way to the tennis
tournament on the campus. Adele and Jo,
the literaries, nibbled their fountain-pens.
</p>
<p>I spread out the manuscripts, side by side,
in a double row on the big sanctum desk,
picked up my scribbled pad, leaned back till
the swivel screw squeaked protestingly from
below, and said, &#8220;Well?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Janet brought her chair down on all four
feet with a bump. &#8220;Nary one is worth a ten
dollar prize,&#8221; she declared pugnaciously, &#8220;especially
now that Robbie Belle has gone to
the infirmary for six weeks and she can&#8217;t help
me in soliciting advertisements.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Laura turned her head. &#8220;Robbie Belle
had promised to write up the first hall play
for me. She was going to review two books
for Jo and compose a Christmas poem for
Adele&#8217;s department. I think maybe there
are perhaps a dozen or so girls who might
have been more easily spared.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span></p>
<p>I brushed a hand across my weary brow.
It did not feel like cobwebs exactly,&mdash;more
like cork, sort of light and dry and full of
holes. I had been up almost all night, studying
over those fifteen manuscripts, applying
the principles of criticism, weighing, balancing,
measuring, arguing with myself, and rebelling
against fate. If Robbie Belle had
been there she could have recognized the best
story by instinct. Ever since I became chief
editor I had depended upon her judgment,
because she is a born critic and always right,
and I&#8217;m not. And now just when I needed
her most of all and more than anybody else,
there she had to go and get quarantined in
the infirmary.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Girls,&#8221; I said, &#8220;do express an opinion.
Say what you think. We simply must decide
this matter now, because the prize story has
to go to press before the first, and this is our
only free afternoon. I know what I think&mdash;at
least I am almost sure what I think&mdash;but I
want to hear your views first. Adele, you&#8217;re
always conscientious.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Adele was only a junior and rather new to
the responsibility of being on the editorial
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
board. She glanced down at her page of
notes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Every one of the stories has some good
points,&#8221; she began cautiously. &#8220;Most of
them start out well and several finish well.
Six have good plots, nine are interesting, five
are brightly written. Number seven is, I believe&mdash;yes,
I think I consider it the best. The
trouble is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Altogether too jerky,&#8221; interrupted Jo, &#8220;a
fine plot but no style whatever. This is a cat.
See the cat catch the rat. That&#8217;s the kind of
English in number seven. Now I vote for
number fifteen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but, Jo,&#8221; I broke in eagerly, for number
seven was my own laborious choice also,
and Adele&#8217;s corroboration strengthened me
wonderfully. &#8220;Jo, it is the simplicity of the
style that is its greatest recommendation.
You know how Professor Whitcomb has
drummed into us the beauty of Anglo-Saxon
diction. It&#8217;s beautiful&mdash;it&#8217;s charming&mdash;it&#8217;s
perfect. Why, a six-year-old could understand
it. Fifteen is far too sensational for
good art. Just listen to this&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jo was stubborn. &#8220;The use of short words
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
is a mere fad,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it is like wearing
dimity for every occasion. Now listen to
this!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She snatched up one manuscript and read
aloud while I declaimed from the other.
Adele listened with a pained frown on her
forehead, Janet laughed and teetered recklessly
to and fro on her frisky chair, Laura
fidgeted at the window and filled every pause
with a threat to leave us instanter for the
tournament positively had to be written up
that day. Finally I put the question to the
vote, for Jo is so decided in her manner that
she makes me feel wobbly unless I am conscious
of being backed up by Robbie Belle. I
suppose it is because my own opinions are so
shaky from the inside view that I hate to appear
variable from the outside. It would
have been horrid to yield to Jo&#8217;s arguments
and change my ideas right there before the
whole board. The rest of them except Jo had
fallen into a way of deferring to my judgment,
for I had seemed to hit it off right almost
always in accepting or rejecting contributions.
Nobody knew how much I had depended on
Robbie Belle.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span></p>
<p>The board awarded the prize to number
seven, my choice, you know. Janet was on
my side because the story had a nice lively
plot, and that was all she cared about. Laura
put in a blank ballot, saying that her head
ached so that it was not fair to either side for
her to cast any weight upon the scale. Adele
of course voted with me. Jo stuck to number
fifteen till the end.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s over!&#8221; sighed Laura and escaped
before any one had put the motion to
adjourn. Janet vanished behind her, and Jo
picked up the manuscript of which she was
champion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way, girls,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I will return
this to its writer, if you don&#8217;t mind. And I
shall tell her to offer it to the Annual. The
committee will jump at the chance. Find out
who she is, please.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I slipped the elastic band from the packet
of fifteen sealed envelopes and selected the one
marked with the title of the story. The name
inside was that of a sophomore who had already
contributed several articles to the
Monthly. Then I opened the envelope belonging
to number seven.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Maria Mitchell Kiewit,&#8221; I read, &#8220;who in
the world is she? I&#8217;ve never heard of her.
She must be a freshman.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jo who was half way out of the room stopped
at the word and thrust her head back around
the door. &#8220;Did little Maria Kiewit write
that? No wonder it is simple and jerky.
She&#8217;s a mathematical prodigy, she is. Her
mother is an alumna of this college. See!
The infant was named after our great professor
of astronomy. She wants to specialize herself
in mathematical astronomy when she gets
to be a junior. Her mother was head
editor of the Monthly in her day. Maria
rooms somewhere in this corridor, I believe.
It will be a big thing for her to win
the prize away from all the upper class girls.
I didn&#8217;t vote for her. By-bye.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; exclaimed Adele, clasping her hands
in that intense way of hers, &#8220;won&#8217;t she be
happy when she hears! A little ignorant unknown
freshman to win the prize for the best
short story among eight hundred students!
Her mother will be delighted. Her mother
will be proud.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hist!&#8221; Jo&#8217;s head reappeared. &#8220;She&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
coming down the corridor now. Red cheeks,
bright eyes, ordinary nose, round chin, long
braid, white shirtwaist, tan skirt&mdash;nothing but
an average freshman. She doesn&#8217;t look like a
mathematical prodigy, but she is one. And
an author, too&mdash;dear, dear! There must be
some mistake. Authors never have curly
hair.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Adele and I poked our faces through the
crack. Jo wickedly flung the door wide open.
&#8220;Walk right out, ladies and gentlemen. See
the conquering heroine comes,&#8221; she sang in a
voice outrageously shrill. During the trill on
the hero, she bowed almost double right in the
path of the approaching freshman. Maria
Mitchell Kiewit stopped short, her eyes as
round as the buttons on her waist.
</p>
<p>Jo fell on her knees, lifting her outspread
hands in ridiculous admiration. &#8220;O Maria
Mitchell Kiewit,&#8221; she declaimed, &#8220;hearken!
I have the honor&mdash;me, myself&mdash;I snatch it,
seize it&mdash;the honor to announce that thou&mdash;thee&mdash;you&mdash;your
own self hast won the ten
dollar prize for the best short story written for
the Monthly by an undergraduate. Vale!&#8221;
She scrambled upright by means of clutching
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
my skirt and put out a cordial hand. &#8220;Nice
girl! Shake!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Josephine!&#8221; gasped Adele in horrified rebuke.
My breath was beginning to come fast
over this insult to our editorial dignity when
I caught sight of the freshman&#8217;s face. Her
cheeks were as red as ever, but she had turned
white about the lips, and her eyes were really
terrified.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t want it!&#8221; she cried involuntarily,
shrinking away from us, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
want it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jo&#8217;s mouth fell open. &#8220;Then why in the
world&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>The little freshman fairly ran to the alleyway
leading to her room.
</p>
<p>Jo turned blankly to us. &#8220;Then why in
the world did she write the story and send
it in?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Adele&mdash;I told you she was conscientious,
didn&#8217;t I? and inclined to be mathematical
herself&mdash;stared at the spot where Maria had
disappeared. &#8220;Such an attitude might be explained
either by the supposition that she is
diffident&mdash;sort of stunned by the surprise, you
understand&mdash;she never expected to win. Or
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
maybe she is shy and dreads the notoriety of
fame. Everybody will be looking at her,
pointing her out. Or&mdash;or possibly&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
Adele hesitated, glanced around uneasily,
caught my eye; and we both dropped our lids
quickly. It was horrid of us. I think it is
the meanest thing to be suspicious and ready
to believe evil of anybody. But truly we had
just been reading a volume of college stories,
and one was about a girl who plagiarized some
poems and passed them off as her own. And
this Maria Mitchell Kiewit had behaved almost
exactly like her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Or possibly what?&#8221; demanded Jo.
</p>
<p>Adele stammered. &#8220;Or p-p-possibly&mdash;oh,
nothing! Maybe she is ashamed of the story
or something like that. She lacks self-esteem
probably. She didn&#8217;t expect it to be published,
you know, and&mdash;and she is surprised.
That&#8217;s all. She&mdash;I guess she&#8217;s surprised.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come along, Adele,&#8221; I slipped my arm
through hers and dragged her away from Jo&#8217;s
neighborhood, &#8220;you must help me reject
these fourteen others. That&#8217;s the part I hate
worst about this editorial business.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want to reconsider the decision?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
called Jo, &#8220;since she doesn&#8217;t wish
the prize herself, you&#8217;d better choose my girl.
This is your last chance. The committee for
the Annual will surely gobble number fifteen
up quick. Berta Abbott knows good literature
when she sees it. Going, going&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let her go. Now, Adele,&#8221; I said, closing
the sanctum door with inquisitive stubborn
Jo safely on the outside, &#8220;here are the rest of
the names. You doubtless know some of
their owners by sight, and I hope I know
others. This is how we shall manage. Whenever
you see one of them securely away from
her room&mdash;maybe in the library or recitation
or out on the campus or down town or anywhere&mdash;you
tell me or else run yourself and
take her manuscript and poke it under her
door. I&#8217;ll write a nice polite little regretful
admiring note to go with each story, and that
ought to take the edge off the blow. But
be sure she is not at home. It would be
simply awful to hand anybody a rejected article
right to her real face and see how disappointed
she is. I think it is more courteous
to give her a chance to recover alone and unobserved.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But suppose she has a roommate?&#8221; said
Adele.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear! Well, in that case we&#8217;ll have
to watch and loiter around till they are both
out of reach. It may take us all the week.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And it actually did. It took a lot of time
but it was exciting too in a way. We felt
like detectives or criminals&mdash;it doesn&#8217;t matter
which&mdash;to haunt the corridors and grounds
till we spied one of those girls headed away
from her room (of course we had to find out
first where each one lived), and then we scurried
up-stairs and down and hung around in
the neighborhood and walked past the door,
if anybody happened to be near, and finally
shoved the manuscript to its goal. Certainly
I understand that we were not obliged to take
all this trouble but I simply could not bear to
send those long envelopes back through the
post. Every student who distributes the mail
would have recognized such a parcel as a rejected
manuscript. And of course that would
have hurt the author&#8217;s feelings.
</p>
<p>Naturally I was rushed that week because
Thanksgiving Day came on Thursday, and I
had an invitation to go down to the city to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
hear grand opera that afternoon. It was
necessary to take such an early train that I
missed the dinner. That evening when I returned
I found the whole editorial board and
Berta too groaning in Lila&#8217;s study while
Laura acted as amanuensis for a composite
letter to Robbie Belle. You see, they had
eaten too much dinner&mdash;three hours at the
table and everything too good to skip. Each
one tried to put a different groan into the letter.
They were so much interested in the
phraseology and they felt so horrid that nobody
offered to get me crackers or cocoa,
though I was actually famishing.
</p>
<p>After poking around in the family cupboard
under the window seat, I routed out a
bag of popcorn. I lighted the gas stove and
popped about three quarts, and then boiled
some sugar and water to crystallize it. When
you are starving, have you ever eaten popcorn
buttered for a first course and crystallized for
a second? It is the most delicious thing!
I had just settled myself in a steamer-chair
with the heaped up pan of fluffy kernels
within reach of my right hand, when there
came a knock on the door.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Enter!&#8221; called Janet.
</p>
<p>The knob turned diffidently and in
marched Maria Mitchell Kiewit.
</p>
<p>Lila pushed another pillow behind Jo on
the couch, Laura lifted her pen, Janet
exerted herself to rise politely. I carelessly
threw a newspaper over the corn, and then
poked it off. After all, editors are only
human, and freshmen might as well learn
that first as last.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish to see Miss Leigh,&#8221; said the visitor
in a high, very young voice that quavered
in the middle.
</p>
<p>I straightened up into a dignified right angle.
&#8220;What can I do for you, Miss Kiewit?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish to withdraw my story,&#8221; she announced
still at the same strained pitch, &#8220;I
have changed my mind. Here is the ten-dollar
bill.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But it went to press three days ago,&#8221; I
exclaimed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the Annual has gobbled up second
choice,&#8221; said Jo triumphantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We jumped at it,&#8221; corroborated Berta.
</p>
<p>&#8220;To take out the prize story now would
spoil the magazine,&#8221; cried Adele.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Impossible!&#8221; declared Janet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; said Laura under her breath.
</p>
<p>The little freshman stared from one to
another. Then suddenly her round face
quivered and crumpled. Throwing up one
arm over her eyes she turned, snatched at
the door knob and stumbled out into the
corridor.
</p>
<p>I looked at Adele.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she replied to my expression,
&#8220;you&#8217;d better go and find out now. It&#8217;s for
the honor of the Monthly. It would be awful
to print a&mdash;a&mdash;mistake,&#8221; she concluded
feebly.
</p>
<p>Just as I emerged from the alleyway I
caught sight of the small figure fluttering
around the corner of a side staircase half way
down the dimly lighted hall. I had to hurry
in order to overtake her before she could reach
her own room. She must have been sobbing
to herself, for she did not notice the sound of
my steps on the rubber matting till I was near
enough to touch her elbow. Then how she
jumped!
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon me, Miss Kiewit. May I speak to
you for one minute?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span></p>
<p>She nodded. I am not observant generally
but this time I could see that she said nothing
because she dared not trust her voice to
speak. She went in first to light the gas.
The pillows on the couch were tossed about in
disorder, and one of yellow silk had a round
dent in it and two or three damp spots as if
somebody had been crying with her face
against it.
</p>
<p>Now I hate to ask direct questions especially
in a situation like this where I wished
particularly to be tactful, and of course she
would be thrust into an awkward position in
case she should dislike to reply. So I sat
down and looked around and said, &#8220;How
prettily you have arranged your room!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The freshman had seated herself on the
edge of her straightest chair. At my speech
she glanced about nervously. &#8220;My mother
graduated here,&#8221; she explained, &#8220;and she
knew what I ought to bring. Ever since I
can remember, she has been planning about
college for me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What a fortunate girl you are!&#8221; This
was my society manner, you understand, for I
was truly embarrassed. I always incline to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
small talk when I have nothing to say. She
caught me up instantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fortunate! Oh, me! Fortunate! When
I hate it&mdash;I hate the college except for math.
My mother teaches in the high school&mdash;she
works day after day, spending her life and
strength and health, so that I may stay here.
I&mdash;I hate it. She wants me to become a
writer. And I can&#8217;t, I can&#8217;t, I can&#8217;t! I want
to elect mathematics.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said I.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When she was a girl, she longed to write,
but circumstances prevented. Then I was
born and she thought I would carry out her
ambition and grow to be an author myself.
She&#8217;s been trying years and years. But I
can&#8217;t write. I&#8217;m not like my mother. I have
my own life to live. I&mdash;I hate it so. And&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; The
child stopped, swallowed
hard, then leaned toward me, her eyes begging
me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And if you keep my story for the prize,
she will hear about it, and she won&#8217;t let me
elect mathematics for my sophomore year.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; I said, and I was surprised to such
a degree that the oh sounded like a giggle at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
the end. That made me so ashamed that I
sat up a little more erect and ejaculated vivaciously,
&#8220;You&mdash;you astonish me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was the funniest thing&mdash;she hung her
head like a conscience-smitten child. &#8220;I&mdash;I
haven&#8217;t told her about it because it would encourage
her and then later she would&mdash;would
be all the more disappointed. I can&#8217;t write,
I tell you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The vote was almost unanimous,&#8221; I remarked
stiffly.
</p>
<p>She stared at me doubtfully. &#8220;Well,
maybe that story is good but I know I
couldn&#8217;t do it again. And anyhow my
mother told me the plot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; I said. It was really the plot that
had won the prize, you understand, though
indeed I had found the style eminently
praiseworthy also according to all the principles
of criticism. It almost fulfilled the
rhetorical rules about unity, mass and coherence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So you will let me withdraw?&#8221; she questioned
timidly, &#8220;here&#8217;s the ten dollars.&#8221; She
held out the crumpled bill which she had
been clutching all the evening.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span></p>
<p>I thought I might as well be going. &#8220;It&#8217;s
allowable to use your own mother&#8217;s plot,&#8221; I
assured her, &#8220;don&#8217;t bother about that. Good
bye.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Without looking at her I hurried through
the alleyway into the corridor, flew past the
sanctum, darted into the staircase, then halted,
turned around, stopped at the water-cooler for
a taste of ice water, then walked slowly back
to her room.
</p>
<p>I put my head in at the door. &#8220;You
heard me say, didn&#8217;t you, that the story has
gone to press?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She lifted her face from that same yellow
silk pillow. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right.&#8221; I started away briskly as if
I thought I was going, but I didn&#8217;t. This
time I turned around, went clear into the
room and sat down on the couch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And anyway,&#8221; I said, &#8220;you haven&#8217;t any
right to deceive your mother like that. It is
robbing her of a joy that she surely deserves.
She has earned it. You haven&#8217;t any right
not to tell her that your story won the prize.
Whether we let you withdraw it or not, it
would be wrong for you to steal that pleasure
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
from your own mother. You are thinking
merely of your own selfish wishes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, no! Don&#8217;t you see?&#8221; She flung
herself toward me. &#8220;It is like being a surgeon.
I must cut out the ambition. I can
never fulfill it. Never, never, I tell you.
The news of this prize will make it grow and
grow like a cancer or something, till it will
hurt worse, maim, kill, when I fail at last.
If she would only see that I love mathematics
and can do something in that maybe some
day. But in literature. Suppose I shut myself
up for years, struggle, struggle, struggle
to wring out something that isn&#8217;t in me,
while she wears herself out to support me.
The publishers will send it back, one after
another. I can&#8217;t write, I tell you. I know
it. It will be all an awful sacrifice&mdash;a useless
sacrifice, with no issue except waste of her life
and my life. Don&#8217;t you see?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think,&#8221; said I calmly, &#8220;don&#8217;t
you think that you are just a little foolish
and intense?&#8221; That is what a professor said
to me once and it had a wonderfully reducing
effect. So I tried it on this excited little
freshman. But the result was different. Instead
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
of clearing the atmosphere with a breeze
of half mortified laughter, it created a stillness
like the stillness before a whirlwind. I
got up hastily. &#8220;I think I had better be
going,&#8221; I said.
</p>
<p>This time I heard the key turn in the lock
behind me as I walked rapidly away. Actually
I had to hold myself in to keep from scuttling
away like a whipped puppy. That is how I
felt inside. I didn&#8217;t believe that she would
ever forgive me. There were two compensations
for this episode in my editorial career:
one was the realization that the little freshman
had plenty of dignity to fall back on, the
other was that she would not be very likely
to ask again for the return of the prize story.
</p>
<p>Considering that this was my sincere attitude,
you may imagine how amazed I was to
hear my name called by this young person the
very next morning. She came running up
to me at the instant my fingers were on the
knob of the sanctum door. Her hands were
filled with those little cardboard rhomboids,
polyhedrons, prisms and so forth which the
freshmen have to make for their geometry
work.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to do it,&#8221; she began breathlessly,
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to tell my mother. Perhaps
it would please her more if&mdash;if you
should write me a note on paper with the
name of the Monthly at the top, you know.
She used to be an editor when she was in college.
In it say that the board gave me the
prize. I think it will please her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be delighted,&#8221; I exclaimed. Then
something in the way she was gazing down
at those geometrical monstrosities (I never
could endure mathematics myself) made me
want to comfort her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, child, it won&#8217;t be necessary to sacrifice
math entirely. You can elect analytics
and calculus to balance the lit and rhetoric.
Cheer up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She raised eyes brimming with tears. &#8220;My
mother thinks that math has an adverse tendency.
She doesn&#8217;t want me to take much
science either. She says that science deals with
facts, literature with the impression of facts.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; I remarked. You notice that I had
found occasion to use the foregoing expletive
several times since first meeting Miss Maria
Mitchell Kiewit.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span></p>
<p>She nodded gloomily in acknowledgment
of my sympathetic comprehension. &#8220;Yes,
once when I described lights in a fog as &#8216;losing
their chromatic identity&#8217; instead of saying
they &#8216;blurred into the mist,&#8217; she asked
me to drop physics in the high school. She
said it was ruinous, it was destroying the
delicacy of my perceptions.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t your mother ever&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; I hesitated,
then decisively, &#8220;doesn&#8217;t she ever
laugh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Maria dimpled suddenly. &#8220;Oh, yes, yes!
She&#8217;s my dearest, best friend, and we have fun
all the time except when she talks about my
becoming a writer. She said that now at college
I could show if there was any hope in
me. She meant that this is my chance to
learn to write. I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She paused and
glanced at me dubiously from under her lashes.
&#8220;I sent in that story just to show her that I
couldn&#8217;t write. I was going to tell her I had
tried and failed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; Then I chuckled, and the freshman
after a moment of half resentful pouting
joined in with a small reluctant laugh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is funny,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I think that maybe
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
from your side of the affair it is awfully funny.
But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>I turned the knob swiftly. &#8220;No but about
it. I shall write that note this minute, and
you shall mail it home at once. That is the
only right thing to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; She heaved a deep, long sigh. &#8220;I
know that. I have worked it all out as an
original in geometry. For instance: Given,
an unselfish mother with a special ambition
for her rebellious selfish daughter. Problem:
to decide which one should sacrifice her own
wishes. Let the mother&#8217;s desire equal this
straight line, and the daughter&#8217;s inclination
equal this straight line at right angles to the
other. To prove&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, little girl,&#8221; I interrupted her
kindly but firmly, &#8220;no wonder your mother
dreads the effect of mathematical studies on
your tender brain! I said farewell to geometry
exactly two years and four months ago. I
did the examination in final trig three times.
Comprehend? Now run into your own room
and get that letter written quick. If you are
very agreeable indeed, I may let you enclose
the proof sheets, who knows?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she exclaimed in impulsive
joy, &#8220;that will be lovely. Mother will be so
pleased.&#8221; Then the vision of coming woe in
exile from beloved calculations descended upon
her, and she hugged the paper figures so convulsively
that the sharpest, most beautiful
angle of the biggest polyhedron cracked clear
across from edge to edge. They were perfectly
splendid clean edges, edges that even I could
see had been formed by the carefully loving
hands of a mathematical prodigy.
</p>
<p>After that day came a pause in the drama
(Adele declared that it was really a tragedy
caused by one life trying to bend another to its
will) until the day when the new issue of the
Monthly arrived in the noon mail. As Robbie
Belle was still in the infirmary of course,
the rest of the board took hold of her share of
the work. We divided the list of subscribers
between us, and started out to distribute the
magazines at the different rooms in the various
dormitories.

SHE WAVED AN OPEN LETTER IN HER HAND
<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span></div>
<p>Part of my route happened to include the
neighborhood of the sanctum. Just as I
turned into Maria&#8217;s alleyway to leave the three
copies always provided for every contributor,
she came dashing out of her room in such a
headlong rush that I barely saved my equilibrium
by a rapid jump to one side. As soon
as she could control her own impetus she
whirled and bore down upon me once more.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mercy, mercy!&#8221; I cried, backing into a
corner by the hinges and holding my pile of
magazines in front as a rampart, &#8220;don&#8217;t be an
automobile any more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She waved an open letter in her hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother says I may elect all the math I
want. She says I can&#8217;t write a little bit. She
says that this prize story shows I can&#8217;t. She
says it is awful&mdash;all except the plot, and that
isn&#8217;t mine, you know. She says that the vocabulary,
sentence structure, everything proves
me mathematical to the centre of my soul.
She says she has always been afraid she was
making a mistake to force a square peg into a
round hole. I&#8217;m the peg, you understand.
She says I needn&#8217;t struggle any more, and
she&#8217;ll be just as proud of a mathematical genius
as of a mechanical author. She says she is
grateful for the honor of the prize, but she
thinks the board of editors made a mistake.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I walked feebly into the room, sank on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
couch, and propped myself against that yellow
silk pillow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s horrid to be an editor,&#8221; I said, &#8220;especially
when Robbie Belle has to go and get
taken to the infirmary just when I need her
most.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My mother knows,&#8221; chanted the little
freshman, &#8220;and she says I can&#8217;t write a little
bit. She says I can elect mathematics.
Whoopee!&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>JUST THIS ONCE</h3>
</div>

<p>Ellen drummed restlessly on the window
pane. &#8220;I&#8217;m &#8217;most sure it would not matter
just this once. We&#8217;ve had the mildest sort of
a fever, and I don&#8217;t see yet why they keep us
shut up so long away off here. I&#8217;m crazy to
send a letter home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lila&#8217;s thin shoulders gave an irritable little
shrug under the silken folds of her dressing-gown,
and her finely cut features screwed for
an instant into an expression of impatient dislike.
It was only for an instant&mdash;then the
mask of her conventional courtesy dropped
again between the two convalescents.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not tell the doctor or the nurse what
you wish to write? They will attend to it for
you. Infection may be conveyed in a dozen
ways, you know. We are beginning to peel,
and that is the worst&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, are we?&#8221; broke in Ellen excitedly,
&#8220;are we really peeling?&#8221; She lifted one hand
and examined the wrist. &#8220;No, I&#8217;m not even
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
beginning. Every morning the moment I
wake up I rub and rub, but it won&#8217;t peel. It
simply won&#8217;t. And I&#8217;ve got to stay here till
I do. Are you peeling? Really?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She darted across to her companion and
seized her arm without noticing the quiver of
distaste before it lay limp in her eager grasp.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, oh, it is, it certainly is! You are
peeling. You will get through first and be
set free and go back to the girls. I shall be
left here alone. It isn&#8217;t fair. We both came
the same day. Think of almost six weeks lost
from college! My first spring in this beautiful
place! It doesn&#8217;t mean so much to you,
because you&#8217;re a junior. You don&#8217;t care.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lila had withdrawn her hand under the
pretext of picking up a case knife to sharpen
her pencil. Now though her lids were
lowered as she hacked at the stubby point,
she was perfectly aware of the hopeful curiosity
in the freshman&#8217;s side glance at her.
Lila despised the habit of side glances. For
the past few days she had felt increasing
scorn of a childishness that sought to vary by
quarrels the monotony of their imprisonment.
Hadn&#8217;t the girl learned yet that she&mdash;Lila
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
Allan, president of the junior literary society&mdash;was
not to be provoked into any undignified
dispute by puerile taunts?
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t care,&#8221; repeated Ellen from her
old position at the window. &#8220;I guess you&#8217;d
rather anyhow have all your time to write
poetry instead of studying.&#8221; She glanced
around just in time to see Lila&#8217;s lips set in a
grimmer line as the lead in the short pencil
snapped beneath a more impatient jab of the
dull knife. She laughed teasingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use of writing all that stuff
now? You&#8217;re wearing out your pencil fast.
Aren&#8217;t you afraid the paper will carry infection?
Or will it be fumigated? I think it
is silly to bother about germs. Oh, dear!&#8221;
She began to drum again on the pane. &#8220;I&#8217;m
so tired of this infirmary. There&#8217;s nothing to
do. I can&#8217;t make up poetry. My eyes ache
if I try to read.&#8221; Here she paused, and Lila
was aware of another side glance in her direction.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My eyes ache if I try to read,&#8221; repeated
Ellen slowly, &#8220;and there is an awfully interesting
story over on the table.&#8221; She stopped
her drumming for a moment to listen to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
steady scribble behind her. The little face
with its round features so unlike Lila&#8217;s delicate
outlines took on a disconsolate expression.
&#8220;Do your eyes ache when you try to read,&#8221;
for an instant she hesitated while a mischievous
spark of daring danced into her eyes.
Then she added explosively, &#8220;Lila?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She had done it. She had done it at last.
Never before through all the weeks of imprisonment
together had she ventured to call
Miss Allan by her first name. A delightful
tingle of apprehension crept up to the back of
her neck. She waited. Now surely something
would happen.
</p>
<p>But nothing happened except the continued
scribble of pencil on paper in the silence. Oh,
dear! this was worse than she had expected.
It was worse than a scolding or a freezing or
an awful squelching. It was the queerest
thing that they were not even acquainted
really after the many weeks. There was a
shell around this junior all the time. It made
Ellen feel meaner and smaller and more insignificant
every minute. The freshman
pressed her forehead wearily against the glass.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, look! There come the girls.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
They&#8217;re your friends away down on the lawn.
Miss Abbott, I think, and Miss Leigh, and
Miss Sanders. See, see! The rollicking wind
and the racing clouds! Their skirts blow.
They hold on their tams. They are looking
up at us. They are waving something.
Maybe it is violets, don&#8217;t you think? Once I
found violets in March. Can&#8217;t you smell the
air almost? I&#8217;m going to open the window.
I am, I am! Who&#8217;s afraid of getting chilled?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I would advise you not to do anything so
utterly foolhardy,&#8221; spoke Lila&#8217;s frigid voice.
A certain inflection in the tone made Ellen
shrink away instinctively. For an instant
she looked full into the serene, indifferent
eyes, and her own seemed to flutter as if
struggling against the contempt she saw there.
Then with a defiant lift of her head she hurried
to the writing table and seized the pencil
which Lila had dropped upon rising to approach
the window.
</p>
<p>A few minutes later when the older girl
turned from the greetings and messages in
pantomime with her friends below, she saw
Ellen&#8217;s rough head bending over a paper. It
was a needlessly untidy head. During the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
weeks of close confinement and enforced companionship,
she had felt her dislike steadily
growing. The girl was on her nerves. She
was wholly disagreeable. Everything about
her was displeasing, her careless enunciation,
queer little face, coarse clothes, impulsive,
crude ways, even occasional mistakes in grammar.
She told herself that the child had no
breeding, no manners, no sense of the fitness
of things. There was no reason why she
should admit her into the circle of her intimates
merely because the two had been
thrown together by the exigencies of an attack
of scarlet fever. Such a fortuitous relation
would be severed in the shortest possible
time, completely and irremediably severed.
Trust Lila Allan, president of the
junior literary society, to manage that.
Meanwhile she intended to leave the girl
severely alone. Think of the impudence of
calling her Lila! Lila, indeed! And that
hint about reading aloud! The incredible
impertinence of it! And to appropriate her
pencil! Atrocious!
</p>
<p>But of course she would keep on being
polite. She owed that to herself, to her position,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
to her self-respect. Accordingly Miss
Allan busied herself graciously about other
matters till Ellen had finished her note, addressed
an envelope, and advanced with it to
the window.
</p>
<p>She hesitated doubtfully, with one hand on
the sash.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t matter just this once,&#8221; she said
as if arguing, &#8220;somebody will pick it up and
mail it for me. It concerns something important
and private. People are silly about
infection. I&#8217;m quite sure it won&#8217;t matter just
this once.&#8221; She paused this time with rather
an anxious little side glance toward Lila.
</p>
<p>That young lady said nothing. She was
engaged in contemplating with a studiously
inexpressive countenance the stub of her
precious and only pencil. It needed sharpening
again.
</p>
<p>Ellen raised the window half an inch.
&#8220;The doctor here is so foolish,&#8221; she commented
with an injured air, &#8220;she&#8217;s always
bothering about infection or contagion or
whatever you call it. It isn&#8217;t necessary
either. I know a doctor at home and he told
a woman to wrap up her little girl and bring
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
her down to his office, and the little girl was
peeling too. He knew it wouldn&#8217;t do any
harm even if she did go in the street car. He
was sensible.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lila smothered a sigh of long suffering as
she reached for the case knife again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I am so tired,&#8221; insisted Ellen with
fretful vehemence. &#8220;I am bored to death,
and nobody amuses me, and my eyes ache
when I try to read, and my wrist won&#8217;t peel,
and all the other girls are enjoying themselves,
and my letter is awfully important
and private, and mother will be so glad to receive
it, and my little sister will snatch it
quick from the postcarrier, and they&#8217;ll all be
glad, and there isn&#8217;t the least bit of danger,
and I&#8217;m going to do it.&#8221; She flung the sash
wide and glanced around for an instant with
a face in which reckless defiance wrestled with
a frightened wish to be dissuaded. &#8220;I&#8217;m going
to do it,&#8221; she repeated, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to do
it&mdash;Lila!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Allan raised her head with a politely
controlled shiver. &#8220;Would you mind closing
the window at your earliest convenience,
Miss Bright?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span></p>
<p>The younger girl gave her one look, then
turned and leaning out over the sill sent the
envelope fluttering downward till it rested
square and white on the concrete walk far below.
Lila shrugged her shoulder and finished
sharpening her pencil.
</p>
<p>In the course of weary time she was set at
liberty. Fair and sweet and delicate in her
fresh array she walked down the corridor in
the centre of an exultant crowd of friends.
In listening to the babel of chatter and
laughter, she forgot utterly her companion in
imprisonment. Just once she happened to
look back from the entangling arms of Bea
and Berta and Robbie Belle, and caught sight
of a forlorn little figure staring after her from
the shadows of the infirmary door. In the
glow of her new freedom and heart-warming
affection, Lila nodded to her with such a
radiant smile that Ellen blushed with joy.
On her journey to her room she told herself
that Miss Allan liked her after all. It was a
solitary journey, for Ellen had boarded in
town till February. After moving into the
dormitory she had barely begun to make acquaintances
before the ogre of fever had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
swooped down upon her and dragged her
away to his den in the isolation ward.
</p>
<p>The vision of that smile must have remained
with her through the troubled weeks that followed;
for one April evening in parlor J she
ventured to invite Miss Allan to dance. Beyond
distant glimpses in the corridors and
chapel, Lila had seen nothing of her fellow
convalescent. To tell the truth, she had taken
pains to avoid any chance association. Once
she had found hardly time to take refuge
behind an <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Engaged</span> sign before the dreaded
little freshman came tiptoeing shyly into the
alleyway. Another time when she spied the
small face waiting with an expectant wistful
half smile at the foot of the stairs she turned
to retrace her steps as if she had suddenly recalled
an errand in another direction.
</p>
<p>On this particular evening, Lila had been
the guest of honor at a senior birthday table.
The senior whose birthday was being celebrated
was chief editor of the Monthly. She
declared that she invited Lila because of the
rhymes that came in so handy to fill up several
pages in the last number of the magazine. As
Lila, lovely in pale rose and blue and silver, sat
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
at the table gay with flowers and shaded candles,
she told the story of how she had written
the verses in the infirmary. On her witty
tongue the stubby pencil, the dull knife, and
the teasing midget of an impudent freshman
made a delightfully humorous tale. Even the
explosive &#8220;Lila!&#8221; and its accompanying side
glance of terrified joy in the daring developed
into a picture that sent the seniors into
tempests of laughter. Somehow she did not
care to mention the letter which Ellen had
dropped out of the window.
</p>
<p>After dinner Lila pressed on with the others
to the dancing in parlor J. The applause and
admiration surrounding her made her look
her prettiest and talk her wittiest, for Lila&#8217;s
nature was always one that throve best in an
atmosphere of praise. She felt as if whirling
through fairyland. In the midst of the gayety
of music, lights, and circling figures, she lifted
her head in gliding past the great mirror and
beheld her own radiant face smiling back at
her from the flower-tinted throng. Just at
that moment through a rift in the throng she
caught a glimpse of two big troubled eyes in a
queer small face atop of a drooping ill-clad
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
form. Half a minute later as she leaned
breathless and glowing against the mirror&#8217;s
gilt frame, she became aware of a timid touch
on her arm. Turning quickly she saw Ellen
beside her. Her smile faded to an expression
of formally polite and distant questioning as
she drew her skirts a few inches away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; the freshman swallowed
once, then pushed out the words with a desperate
rush, &#8220;will you dance with me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Miss Bright,&#8221; exclaimed Lila in an
overwhelmingly effusive manner, &#8220;I am so
dreadfully sorry, but I regret to say that I am
already engaged for every number. Good-bye!&#8221;
She slid her hand about her partner&#8217;s
waist and propelled her swiftly into the concealing
vortex of waltzers.
</p>
<p>The partner in question happened to be a
certain lively and independent young person
called Bea by her friends. &#8220;Lila Allan,&#8221; she
scolded as soon as she could steer their steps
to a sheltered eddy in a corner, &#8220;why in the
world did you snub that poor child so unmercifully?
After six weeks together in the
infirmary too! I&#8217;m downright ashamed of
you. You ought to be above snobbishness.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
And it isn&#8217;t a point of snobbishness either.
It is plain cruelty to children. Didn&#8217;t you
see how you hurt her? And the poor little
thing has enough trouble without your adding
to the burden.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Trouble?&#8221; echoed Lila uneasily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, trouble. Haven&#8217;t you heard? Her
little sister is desperately ill with scarlet
fever. Infection conveyed in a letter, I understand.
A telegram may come for her any
hour. And then when she tries to cheer up,
you treat her so abominably! Lila, you are
growing more and more spoiled every day.
People praise you too much. You were born
with a silver spoon in your mouth. You&#8217;ve
improved a lot since you first began to room
with me, but still&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lila had vanished. Winding her swift way
between the circling pairs, she hurried into
the corridor where girls were strolling idly as
they waited for the gong to summon them to
chapel. Beyond the broad staircase Ellen&#8217;s
disconsolate little figure stood in the glare of
the gas-jet over the bulletin-board.
</p>
<p>Lila hastened toward her. &#8220;Miss Bright,
oh, Miss Bright, I did not know. I am exceedingly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
sorry. You will keep me posted?
If there is anything that I can do, of course&mdash;I
feel&mdash;I feel&mdash;so guilty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ellen raised her face. Her mouth was
trembling at the corners. &#8220;I sent the letter,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;I&#8217;m waiting.&#8221; She winked rapidly
and her odd features worked convulsively for
a moment. &#8220;If&mdash;if they telegraph&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Bright.&#8221; It was the voice of a messenger
girl who had that instant emerged
from an adjacent apartment. &#8220;Will you step
into the office at once, if you please? There
is a message&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ellen was gone like a flash. Lila walked
across to the staircase and very deliberately
seated herself with her head resting against
the banisters. It was there that Bea found
her a few minutes later when the stream of
students was beginning to set toward the
chapel doors.
</p>
<p>Bea was startled. &#8220;Lila, what is it? You
look like a ghost. Shall I get some water?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lila opened her eyes. &#8220;I think that her
little sister is dead,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; Bea clasped her hands in pity.
&#8220;How can we help?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I think that I killed her,&#8221; said Lila.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; It was almost a shout. Then
noticing that several girls turned to stare
curiously in passing, Bea put out her hand.
&#8220;Come, Lila, get up. It&#8217;s time to go to
chapel. You don&#8217;t realize what you&#8217;re saying.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She rose obediently in mechanical response
to the gesture.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was my fault because I was the older
and I knew the danger. She was only a
freshman. She wanted me to persuade her
not to drop that letter from the window. I
could have kept her from feeling lonely. I
made her reckless. It wasn&#8217;t her fault. But
now her little sister is dead.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know she is?&#8221; asked Bea.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A message came.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; They slipped into a pew near
the rear of the chapel. During the reading
of Scripture, Lila sat gazing blankly straight
before her over the rows of heads, dark and
fair. As if in a dream she rose with the others
for the singing of the hymn. Still as
though moving in a mist, she sank again into
her seat and bowed her forehead upon the pew
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
in front. While the rustling murmur was
subsiding into a hush before the prayer, she
stirred and lifting her face turned for one
fleeting moment toward the wide doors at the
back. Ah! She raised her head higher to
watch, motionless, breathless. The doors were
noiselessly swinging shut behind a girl with a
queer small face atop of an ill-clad little figure.
But the face instead of being crumpled in
grief was alight with joy; and the little figure
advanced with a lilt and a swing, as if just
freed from a burden.
</p>
<p>The message had been a message of good
tidings.
</p>
<p>Lila watched the child slip exultantly into
a convenient corner. Then with a sudden,
swift movement the older girl dropped full
upon her knees and covered her eyes with her
hands.

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>CLASSMATES</h3>
</div>

<p>Bea reached for Robbie with one arm,
grasped Lila with the other, and went skipping
after the rest of the seniors over the lawn
to their class tree. She dragged them under
its spreading branches to the centre of the
throng that had gathered in the June twilight.
Berta was already there, mounted on a small
platform that had been built against the
trunk in preparation for the morrow&#8217;s Class
Day ceremonies.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She looks pretty decent,&#8221; whispered Bea
to Robbie in order to frustrate the queer sensation
in her throat at sight of the eager face
laughing above them on this last evening together
before the deluge of commencement
guests. &#8220;I hope the alumnæ who are wandering
around admire our taste in presidents.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; Robbie spoke reflectively,
&#8220;they&#8217;re almost as much interested in their
classmates as we are in ours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Um-m,&#8221; said Bea, &#8220;why, maybe so they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
are. I never thought of that before. Robbie,
you&#8217;re my liberal education. Now, then, attention!
Berta is raising her hand to mark
time for the songs to be rehearsed for to-morrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Berta&#8217;s hand dropped at sound of a
shout from across the campus. &#8220;There!&#8221;
she exclaimed, &#8220;the sophomores are coming.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They certainly were coming, on a double-quick
march, two by two, shouting for the
seniors. As they approached the shouting
changed to singing. When they reached the
tree, they spread out and joining hands went
skipping, still viva voce, around the seniors
who watched them, silent and smiling. The
air was sweet with the cool, spicy breath of
spruces. Lila thought that she could even
smell the roses in the garden beyond the
evergreens. She lifted her face toward the
soft evening sky, and her mouth grew wistful.
Bea caught a glimpse of it, and immediately
became voluble if not eloquent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is impromptu,&#8221; she commented, generous
with her least thoughts. &#8220;I enjoy impromptus,
except speeches&mdash;or that last lecture
when the man couldn&#8217;t read his own
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
notes. Now my history which is to astonish
the world to-morrow will doubtless glitter
with extemporaneous wit which has cost me
two weeks of meditation. Likewise this impromptu
on the spur of the moment&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s beautiful,&#8221; said Robbie. She
was watching Berta&#8217;s eyes as the last lingering
strains died away. Oh, dear! why did they
sing that good-bye serenade again? Berta
was going to cry. Hark! A robin&#8217;s twilight
call rose melodiously from the heart of a
shadowy spruce. In the thrill of it Robbie
felt the sting of sudden tears. She turned to
Bea.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I know how Berta feels when she
listens to music. I&#8217;m beginning to understand.
But I think a robin is different from
a brass band.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it now? You astonish me.&#8221; Bea
squeezed her understandingly, nevertheless.
&#8220;I know. Being with Lila has taught me a
lot. She is like a windharp&mdash;every touch
finds a response. Berta&#8217;s a violin, I guess.
It takes skill to play on her. And you&mdash;oh,
I believe you&#8217;re a splendid big drum. You&#8217;ve
been marking time for the rest of us all the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
four years. As for me, I&#8217;m only an old tin
horn. You need to spend all your breath to
get any music. Even then it isn&#8217;t sickeningly
sweet, so to speak. Still for an audience
in sympathy with the performer&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is what college has given us,&#8221; put in
Lila who had been listening, &#8220;it gives us
sympathy. Being with different persons, you
know, and loving them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes!&#8221; Robbie&#8217;s sigh of intense assent
left her breathless, &#8220;loving them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, then, girls!&#8221; Berta&#8217;s hand was
lifted again to beat time as the clapping for
the sophomores subsided. Then the seniors
sang. They sang the songs that were to be
interspersed as illustrations in Bea&#8217;s class history.
There was the elegant stanza which
they had shouted all the way to the mountain
lake that first October at college.
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;&#8217;Rah, &#8217;rah, &#8217;rah! kerchoo, kerchoo!</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 2em;'>We are freshmen&mdash;</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 4em;'>Who are you?&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>From that brilliant composition the selections
ranged through four years of fun and
sentiment with an occasional flight to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
poetry of earnest feeling as well as many a
joyous swoop into hilarious inanity.
</p>
<p>When tired of standing around the tree,
the class fluttered across the campus to the
broad stone steps in front of the recitation
hall.
</p>
<p>Bea clung to Robbie&#8217;s arm again and
reached for Lila in their flight. &#8220;I&#8217;m &#8217;most
sure we look like nymphs flying through the
glades, with our draperies blowing in the
lines of swift motion. I love to run when I
feel like it. Robbie Belle, shall we ever dare
to run when we get home?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Robbie did not hear her. From her seat
on the steps she gazed at Berta who was
standing before the ranks of familiar faces,
her eager face alight with the exhilaration of
the hour. Once she threw back her head,
laughing at some ridiculous verse. Her eyes
sought Robbie&#8217;s for an instant, smiled, then
danced away again. Robbie swallowed once,
unconsciously, and moved closer to Bea.
</p>
<p>In a semicircle sweeping around the group
of singers, sophomores and stray juniors and
many a wandering alumna in a flower-decked
hat had gathered to listen. In a pause between
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
the songs. Robbie surveyed them
gravely, unrecognizing any of the older
guests until presently one face stood out
vaguely familiar in the clear twilight. It
was a beautiful face, framed by dusky hair beneath
the wreath of crimson roses on her hat.
The eyes were dusky too and deep-set. They
were staring at Robbie with an intensity of
grieving affection that contrasted sharply with
the stern, almost resentful, expression of her
finely cut mouth.
</p>
<p>As Robbie gazed back in fascinated perplexity,
the face suddenly curved into a smile
so tenderly radiant that Robbie felt quite
dazzled for a moment. Involuntarily she
smiled back, while striving to grasp the dim
recollection. Who could it be? She had surely
seen her before somewhere. But where? At
college? At home? Where was it? Slowly
a vision grew distinct in her groping memory.
It was a vision of Elizabeth, her sister, lifting
a photograph from a pile of others. &#8220;This,&#8221;
she had said, &#8220;is my Jessica. She knows all
my family from their pictures, and some day
she shall come home with me and meet you
your own selves. She wishes Robbie Belle
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
were to enter college before we finish. Robbie
will be a senior when we go back for our fifth
year reunion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Robbie&#8217;s chest heaved abruptly under the
shock of identifying the face amid the encircling
throng. It was Jessica More, Elizabeth&#8217;s
best friend at college. This was the
June of her class reunion. Robbie Belle was
a senior. But Elizabeth was not there, as
she had planned. Jessica had been expelled
before she graduated, and Elizabeth had died.
</p>
<p>Before the singing was over, Jessica had
disappeared. Then in the rush of last things
Robbie forgot her for a time. Some of the
seniors hurried away on hospitable duties
bent, for numerous relatives had already arrived.
There were to be informal gatherings
in different rooms. A few went to the Phi
Beta Kappa lecture in the chapel. To tell
the truth, however, these were but few indeed,
for to the seniors the last evenings were
too precious, to be wasted on mere scholarly
discourse. Probably Jessica had gone there
with the rest of the alumnæ, reflected Robbie
Belle as she sat beside Berta and the others in
the soft sweet darkness. With arms intertwined
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
they talked low or fell silent, lingering
over this farewell to the dear college
days.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I love everybody in the class,&#8221; whispered
Lila once.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In the college,&#8221; amended Bea promptly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, in the whole world!&#8221; exclaimed
Berta.
</p>
<p>Robbie nodded assent so solemnly that Bea
leaned down to peer at her more closely. &#8220;A
regular Chinese mandarin,&#8221; she teased, &#8220;or
are you nodding in your sleep? You approve
of Berta&#8217;s breadth evidently. Why do people
always speak about the value of being broadened?
I think it is nobler to be deep than
broad, I do. I&#8217;d rather divide my heart in
four pieces than in forty billion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are two hundred in the class,&#8221; said
Robbie, &#8220;and there were only one hundred in
my sister&#8217;s class, but I am quite sure that they
did not love each other any more than we do.&#8221;
</p>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span></div>
<p>The next morning saw the seniors assemble
at the amphitheatre which had been prepared
for the Class Day exercises. Berta was already
on the platform, assisting the committee
in the arrangement of seats for the class.
Among later comers who were hurrying across
the campus Bea caught up with Robbie Belle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am hastening across the sward,&#8221; she announced
in cheerfully inane greeting, &#8220;what
is a sward anyhow, and why isn&#8217;t it pronounced
the same as sword?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s grass,&#8221; said Robbie Belle. Bea felt a
speaking silence fall and glanced up to catch
the direction of her gaze. Between them and
the expanse of mingled chairs and girls around
the platform against the wall of the nearest
dormitory, a stranger was moving rapidly
toward them, her eager eyes on Robbie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Little Robbie Belle! I knew you last
night from your picture.&#8221; She held both
hands, smiling.
</p>
<p>Bea considered the two pairs of shoulders
on a level. &#8220;Little!&#8221; she sniffed to herself,
&#8220;it must be a very old alum.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Robbie turned to introduce her. &#8220;This is
my friend, Beatrice Leigh, Miss More. Bea,
this is my sister&#8217;s best friend. I remembered
you too, last night, Miss More. I remembered&mdash;I&mdash;I
wondered&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Robbie&#8217;s tongue
stumbled in embarrassment at the verge of
candor.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span></p>
<p>Miss More&#8217;s mouth hardened slightly, though
her eyes still smiled. &#8220;You wondered how I
happen to be here for the reunion of a class
from which I was expelled. Is that it? Perhaps
you are unaware that I have been reinstated.
The faculty has at last reconsidered
their unjust decision. They acknowledge that
it was based upon a misunderstanding. I
have made up the work at home. To-morrow
I shall receive two degrees, the Bachelor&#8217;s
with your class, the Master&#8217;s with the
post-graduates. I am sure you congratulate
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; gasped Robbie Belle, &#8220;oh, yes!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bea succeeded in depressing somewhat the
round-eyed stare with which she had listened
to this extraordinary speech. &#8220;I think it is
perfectly lovely, Miss More,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Your
class must be delighted. It is a triumph&mdash;a
splendid triumph. Oh,&mdash;ah!&#8221; She turned
at the sound of a faint call behind her:
&#8220;Jessica!&#8221;
</p>
<p>From a group of alumnæ under a cluster of
spruces, somebody was walking quickly toward
the three. Bea recognized in her a brilliant
young instructor at the college.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Jessica, I am&mdash;glad. How do you do?&#8221;
She put out her hand.
</p>
<p>Miss More lifted her eyes, coolly scanned
the other woman from the tip of her russet
shoes to the crown of her sailor hat, then gazed
vacantly over her head, before addressing Robbie
again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then to-morrow, Robbie. Don&#8217;t forget
that I wish to see you after the commencement
exercises for a few minutes. There are
questions I desire to ask. Your mother is
well, I hope.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Two minutes later Robbie had reached one
of the chairs and dropped into it with a limpness
strangely inharmonious with her statuesque
proportions. &#8220;Bea, they belong to the
same class.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bea sank down beside her. &#8220;That was awful&mdash;awful.
Those others were watching her
from the path. Why did she do it? I don&#8217;t
understand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Robbie passed her hand across her forehead.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite remember everything,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;but I have an impression that it was Miss
Whiton who was to blame for having Miss
More expelled. She was class president, or
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
something, and felt responsible. Elizabeth
said she thought it was for the honor of the
college. She meant to do right. And now to
think it was all a mistake! Miss More will
receive her degrees to-morrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did Miss Whiton accuse her of any wrong
or make complaint?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not exactly. I think she believed
that Miss More&#8217;s behavior somewhere reflected
on the college, and she considered it her duty
to report the circumstances. Or maybe it was
appearances&mdash;it seems now that it must have
been only appearances. That started the
trouble, and Miss More resented it. She was
stubborn or indifferent about some requirements.
I don&#8217;t remember quite what, and
Elizabeth never liked to talk about it. Elizabeth
wrote to her every week until she&mdash;until
she left us.&#8221; Robbie&#8217;s lip twitched suddenly.
Bea saw it and gently passing her arm through
the other&#8217;s arm drew her on to join the class
assembled at the amphitheatre.
</p>
<p>The next day brought commencement.
Bea from her place among the rows of white-clad
seniors in the body of the chapel could
by bending forward slightly catch a glimpse
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
of Miss More&#8217;s profile at the head of the
front pew at the right. When she raised her
eyes she could see Miss Whiton&#8217;s coldly regular
features conspicuous in their clean-cut
fairness among the younger instructors in the
choir-seats behind the trustees on the platform.
Bea had never liked Miss Whiton. It
seemed to her now, as she studied the immobile
face, that she had always recognized there
a suggestion of the self-righteous Pharisee.
There could be nothing but misunderstanding
and antagonism between the possessor of
such a countenance and Miss More with those
eyes of hers, that nose and that mouth. Bea&#8217;s
labors over the classes in manners had included
some research in the subject of physiognomy.
Now she leaned forward to secure
another view of that profile in the front pew.
Then she settled back with the contented sigh
of an investigator whose surmise has proved
correct. Miss More&#8217;s features certainly expressed
an impulsive, reckless and lovable temperament
as opposed to Miss Whiton&#8217;s conscientious
and calculating prudence. Oh, yes,
there was conscience enough in the icily handsome
face among the instructors. It was conscience
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
doubtless that had driven her across the
campus to speak to Miss More on Class Day
morning. Bea sighed again, this time with a
faint twinge of sympathy. She generally
meant well herself. A conscience was a very
queer thing&mdash;she thought so still even if she
had heard it all explained and analyzed in
senior ethics.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Surgite.&#8221; That was Prexie&#8217;s voice. The
class rose in obedience to the word. Bea
found herself standing with the others while
the Latin sentences rolled melodiously over
their heads. She never could translate from
hearing. Absently her glance sought the
front pew where Miss More had turned to
watch them. The girl&#8217;s wistful gaze caught
the expression of passionate regret in her
deep-set eyes, and clung there fascinated for
an endless moment before tearing itself
free.
</p>
<p>After it was over, after the class had filed
upon the platform to receive their diplomas,
after Prexie had delivered his annual address
and the procession of graduates, alumnæ and
faculty had marched out into the golden sunshine,
Bea drew aside to wait under an elm.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
Berta spied her and beckoned, then came hurrying.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lila is over at the doors on guard to capture
the various relatives and start them toward
the cottages for dinner. The trustees
entertain the alumnæ in the main dining-room.
The seniors will go to Strong Hall.
Aren&#8217;t you ready?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m getting an impression,&#8221; answered Bea,
&#8220;gothic portals, graceful elms, bare-headed
girls in white, sun-flecked lawns and glimpse
of the sparkling lake beyond, groups intermingling&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll help give you that impression.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bea slipped nimbly out of reach in time to
escape the promised pinch&mdash;or it may have
been a squeeze.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got it already&mdash;a hundred of them.
You&#8217;re in two or three. And Robbie&mdash;do you
see Robbie anywhere?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Robbie approached at the moment. &#8220;Bea,
have you noticed Miss More pass? I found
something last night in my sister&#8217;s college
scrapbook&mdash;her memory-bill, you know. It
is something for Miss More.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, over there half way to the main
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
building. Look&mdash;that one in white all alone.
You can overtake her if you hurry, Robbie.
Oh, Berta!&#8221; Bea turned and held out one
hand impulsively. &#8220;If you could only have
seen her eyes while she watched us in
chapel! She was thinking of her own class,
how she had been driven away from them in
disgrace. It was tragic. She&mdash;she&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Bea
gulped and caught herself back from falling
over the brink into the pit of palpable emotion.
&#8220;In fact, I am almost sure she&mdash;hm-m,&mdash;envied
us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She glanced apprehensively at her companion
in dread of the usual quick teasing rejoinder;
but Berta was soberly gazing after
Robbie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Robbie has dropped a paper, Bea,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;I saw it flutter. Come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bea flitted across the grass, her bright hair
an aureole in the sunlight. Her fingers seized
the bit of white; her eyes read the message:
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;Sunday evening after Bible lecture.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jessica and the rest of us are choosing
mottoes to live out just for experiment this
week.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Marian: &#8216;Love seeketh not her own.&#8217;
(She always gets to places first.)
</p>
<p>&#8220;Alice: &#8216;Is not easily provoked.&#8217; (Oh, oh!)
</p>
<p>&#8220;Louise: &#8216;Is not puffed up.&#8217; (Ah!)
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jessica: &#8216;is kind.&#8217; (And when she is
good, she is very, very good.)
</p>
<p>Elizabeth: &#8220;envieth not.&#8221; (My brain
doesn&#8217;t suit.)
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jessica says hers is the easiest because it
means just to keep from hating anybody, and
she loves the whole college.&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;Oh, I didn&#8217;t mean to read it.&#8221; Bea almost
clapped her hand over her impetuous
eyes. &#8220;Robbie,&#8221; she broke into a run, &#8220;Robbie
Belle, here is something you dropped.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As Robbie turned at the call, one of the
trustees, an elderly woman whose white hair
seemed to soften the effect of her energetic
manner and keen gaze, paused to speak to
Miss More. The two seniors strolled on at a
leisurely pace while waiting for an opportunity
to ask attention without interrupting
a speech. The distance intervening lessened
step by step till Bea could not help overhearing
the trustee&#8217;s distinct low tones.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&mdash;&mdash;exceedingly difficult to choose between
the two candidates. Their qualifications
balance distractingly. Personally I incline
to Miss Whiton, and I should very much
like to see her win this unusual position.
Her original work certainly deserves it. However
I know her so slightly that I am reluctant
to give my decisive vote until I learn
more of her from her contemporaries. You
were in her class, Miss More, I understand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At the smothered intensity of that simple
word, Bea&#8217;s head rotated swiftly to stare at
the source of it. She had never seen that
beautiful face like this before. On the campus
Class Day morning it had been friendly
though with the hint of hardness about the
mouth. In chapel it had been tragic with
regret over the irrevocable. Now the dusky
eyes were blazing with the light of coming
triumph over an enemy at last delivered into
her power.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is an exceptional distinction for so
young a woman,&#8221; continued the trustee, &#8220;and
because it means so much to each of the
rivals, a feather&#8217;s weight of evidence may turn
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
the scales for one or the other. I am anxious
to be impartial. I invite this discussion
merely to assure myself of Miss Whiton&#8217;s irreproachable
record. I wish sincerely to see
her win.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You never heard the exact circumstances
that led to my expulsion from college?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The defiant ring of this abrupt question
brought Bea to her sense of the situation.
She put out one hand to draw Robbie beyond
earshot. But Robbie did not notice her. She
was already touching Miss More&#8217;s arm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss More, pardon me. I have hurried
to give you this. I&mdash;I think Elizabeth would
have enjoyed showing it to you. I&mdash;wish&mdash;she
could have been here to-day. She would
have been&mdash;glad.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss More took the paper mechanically.
&#8220;Thank you, Robbie Belle. Will you wait
one moment, dear? I want to speak to you.&#8221;
She turned again to the older woman. &#8220;It
may be an enlightening little tale,&#8221; she began,
&#8220;and Miss Whiton plays a part in it.
These are the facts.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bea watched her, fascinated. The eyes
seemed to be gazing away beyond the evergreens
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
at old, unhappy, far-off things. Slowly
they returned to nearer objects, dropped suddenly
and caught for an instant upon some
one passing by. At sight of the swift gleam
of bitter recognition, Bea followed the direction,
and beheld Miss Whiton. She looked
back again in time to see a wonderful change
as Miss More&#8217;s glance traveled unconsciously
to the paper in her hand.
</p>
<p>Robbie&#8217;s wistful regard was also lingering
upon the paper.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Elizabeth loved it all&mdash;the class&mdash;the
whole college.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The trustee was evidently in haste. &#8220;And
this enlightening little tale of yours, Miss
More? Pardon me for urging you on. The
importance of the issue&mdash;ah!&#8221; Bea saw her
nod acquiescence in response to a gesture from
some one who was waiting at the porte
cochere. &#8220;I fear I shall not have time for it
now. May I consult you later? You are
sure, Miss More, that the story is something
that I ought to hear?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss More hesitated. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she
said slowly. &#8220;It may have been merely a
schoolgirl misunderstanding. I will&mdash;think
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
it over and let you know after the dinner. In
any event, I thank you for your confidence.
Miss Whiton certainly merits the honor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It seemed to Bea that Miss More looked
after the older woman with an expression of
half-puzzled surprise at her own indecision.
Then she turned to Robbie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember that evening,&#8221; she spoke in a
curiously softened tone. &#8220;Elizabeth sat in
the glow of the drop-light and scribbled this
card, while the rest of us watched her idly,
and talked, half serious, half in fun over the
novelty of choosing our mottoes. It was
Elizabeth who had proposed it. She had such
a shy, sweet, humorous way of being good.
Everybody loved her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Robbie nodded speechlessly. After a moment
she said, &#8220;The rest of your verse is
&#8216;Love suffereth long and is kind.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>The deep-set eyes clouded again under the
dusky hair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;have&mdash;suffered,&#8221; she said slowly.
</p>
<p>Bea pinched her own arm in a quick agony
of vicarious embarrassment. How could a
person show her feelings right out like that
before anybody? What was the use of going
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
around talking about such things? It was
not very polite to make other people uncomfortable.
Bea smothered a quick little sob and
walked on, staring straight ahead.
</p>
<p>It was Robbie who turned to look into the
face so near her own. She saw the clouds lift
before the dawning of an exquisite smile like
a ray of sunshine after a stormy day.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Love suffereth long and is kind,&#8217;&#8221; repeated
the oddly gentle voice. &#8220;I have suffered,
and I will try&mdash;to be kind. I think
Elizabeth would have been glad.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Elizabeth is glad,&#8221; said Robbie Belle.

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>VICTORY</h3>
</div>

<p>At her escape into the corridor Berta paused
for a moment in the shadow of the staircase
to brush the excitement from her glowing
face. She winked rapidly once or twice in
hopes of smothering the sparkle in her eyes,
but succeeded only in nicking a happy tear
drop from her lashes. Then she smoothed
the dimple from her cheek and tried to
straighten her lips into the sober dignity
proper for a senior who was on the honor list
and had just come from an interview with the
critic of her commencement essay.
</p>
<p>Her efforts were all in vain, however, for at
the very minute that the dimple came dancing
out again and the rebellious mouth quivered
back into its joyous curves, somebody with a
swift tap-tap-tap of light heels flew down the
stairs in a rustle and a flutter and darted toward
Berta.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span></p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve come! They&#8217;re here! The
Board of Editors is going to meet in the lecture
room immediately to open the boxes.
Four big beautiful boxes full of splendid great
books all in green with gilt lettering. Hurry!
Hurry quick yourself! You&#8217;re head literary
editor. It&#8217;s really your book&mdash;the ideas, editorials,
verses, farce, everything! The sale
opens at five. Everybody&#8217;s crazy to see the
new senior Annual. Our Annual! Oh,
Berta!&#8221; She seized the taller girl around
the waist and whirled her down the hall till
loose sheets of paper from her dangling note-book
flitted merrily hither and yon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bea, take care! You&#8217;re crumpling my
essay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your essay? Oh, that&#8217;s so! Senior president,
Annual editor, honor girl, commencement
speaker, graduate fellow-heigho! She
&#8216;bore her blushing honors thick upon her.&#8217;
No wonder you look uplifted. Listen! Behold!
Tell me, do her little feet really touch
the solid humble earth?&#8221;
</p>
<p>As mischievous Bea stopped, with anxiety
and awe written large on her saucy features
to investigate Berta&#8217;s shoes, a door near them
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
opened and a slender woman with fast-graying
hair and a curiously still face emerged.
There was the ghost of a twinkle in her gray
eyes. The transom had not been entirely
closed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Abbott, may I take that essay again,
for a few minor suggestions? If you will
drop in after chapel I shall have it ready for
you. Permit me once more to congratulate
you on its excellence and originality. It has
never been my pleasure to read any undergraduate
work of greater promise.&#8221; She withdrew
after the nicker of a quizzical smile in
Bea&#8217;s direction.
</p>
<p>That young lady gasped and then happening
to notice that her mouth was ajar
carefully closed it with the aid of both
hands.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Berta Abbott! To have your essay
praised by Miss Thorne the terrible, who
never approves of anything, and yet you
stand there like a common mortal! You live,
you breathe, you walk, you talk, just the
same as you used to do! She says it has
promise. I do believe that she never said as
much before about anybody except maybe
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
Shakespeare when he was young. Oh, just
wait until she sees the Annual!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Berta had colored hotly. &#8220;Bea, don&#8217;t tell
anybody, please. Of course, I care what she
says. I care most of all&mdash;I care heaps&mdash;about
her opinion that the qualities are&mdash;are promising.
But if I should fizzle out and never
amount to anything! It&#8217;s all in the future,
you see, and I&#8217;d be so ashamed to have the
girls quoting her now. If I shouldn&#8217;t win
the fellowship, if I had to go to teaching next
year and give it up&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bea pounced upon her. &#8220;You&#8217;re a nice
sweet girl, and I love you to distraction.
Don&#8217;t you worry about that fellowship, but
trot up-stairs with me this instant and help
hammer the covers off those boxes. You&#8217;ll
be surprised!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I?&#8221; said Berta idly, as she followed
in Bea&#8217;s eddying wake, &#8220;I don&#8217;t see how,
since I read the proof and corrected the lists
of names.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hm!&#8221; Bea turned confidentially and
shot an alarming sentence toward her companion.
&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll tell you; everything you
wrote is signed. The other editors did it last
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
thing&mdash;sometimes your initials, sometimes
your name. It&#8217;s for the sake of your reputation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My reputation!&#8221; exclaimed the victim.
&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she groaned, &#8220;they did that? Oh, my
land! My name on everything. I shall
sink through the floor. Run, run quick!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The corridors were almost deserted during
that recitation period. There was no stray
freshman in sight to gaze scandalized at the
vision of two reverend seniors racing toward
the lecture room door. Berta dashed in just
as the chairman of the board, with hair flying
and cheeks flushed from the exertion, was
brandishing a hatchet in one hand and a
splintered fragment of wood in the other.
The business editor hammered away with
characteristic energy at the ragged remnants.
The rest stood around waiting as patiently as
possible in their weaponless zeal. Several
glanced up and grinned provokingly at the
appearance of their head literary editor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;ve heard the news, have you?&#8221;
began the artist, &#8220;you look wild. We knew
you&#8217;d never consent to sign the things yourself,
and it was rank injustice to let you do
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
the work and receive no special credit. Even
the ideas are yours, but we couldn&#8217;t tag a name
to them. Wish we could. That one for the
main feature&mdash;the pictures of distinguished
alumnæ&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on!&#8221; the chairman backed into a
convenient corner before Berta&#8217;s frenzied reproaches,
&#8220;it&#8217;s all right. We added a note of
explanation. Nobody will blame you for
writing so well. And the initials are very
small anyhow. Here, look!&#8221; She made a
dive for the box, ripped off a second board
with quick blows, snatched away the wrapping
paper underneath, and dislodged a handsome
green volume from its snug nest. She
thrust it into Berta&#8217;s hands. &#8220;It&#8217;s your book
really more than anybody&#8217;s&mdash;your first published
book.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Berta took it, sat down in a desk-chair
near by, and turned the leaves slowly with
fingers that trembled from nervousness.
</p>
<p>Bea bent over her shoulder. &#8220;It seems
as if that name of yours is on every page,&#8221;
she teased, &#8220;pretty name, don&#8217;t you think?
And isn&#8217;t it a beautiful, beautiful book! Wide
margins, heavy paper, clear print, fine reproductions.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
Won&#8217;t the girls be delighted with
those pictures of the basket ball teams! See,
ah, there is the page of photographs. You
suggested that the editors should appear as
the babies they used to be forty years or so
ago. What a dear little curly-head you were
at the age of two, Berta! I want to hug
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The embarrassment began to fade from
Berta&#8217;s expression as she gazed at the baby
faces before her. &#8220;That&#8217;s the great thing I
miss at college, don&#8217;t you, Bea? There aren&#8217;t
any babies here. We ought to borrow some
once in a while to vary the monotony of books.
I have three little nieces at home, you know.
Such darlings! I wish I had one here now
this minute.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Which do you choose&mdash;the baby or the
book? Oh, Berta! Would you sacrifice this
book for a mere child? This beautiful, splendid,
green book with gilt lettering and your
name scrawled everywhere?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The oldest baby looks a good deal like that
photograph of me,&#8221; continued Berta softly,
&#8220;she is named after me, too. I wish you
could see her. The way she holds up her little
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
arms and clings to you! I haven&#8217;t seen
her since last September.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hark!&#8221; Bea sprang from her perch on a
desk-arm. &#8220;There are the girls now clamoring
for admission. It must be the hour for
the sale to begin. Isn&#8217;t it fun! Fly, Berta
Abbott, flee and bury your blushes. The play
is now on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Berta fled. She felt an impulse to creep
away into some dark corner till all the excitement&mdash;and
criticism&mdash;had subsided. Of
course, it was rather pleasant, she acknowledged
reluctantly to her candid self. There
was something down underneath tingling and
glowing. Very likely it was gratified vanity.
Everybody liked to be praised and admired,
but not too much, for that was uncomfortable.
It was like being set upon a pinnacle and
stared at. And she did care. She had worked
hard and long for success. She had proved
that she could work. Now if she should be
granted the foreign fellowship, she could go
on and on, step by step, till some day perhaps
she might become a famous college professor
or maybe the president of a university. That
would be accomplishing a career worth while.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span></p>
<p>Berta never quite remembered how she
screwed up resolution enough to enter the
dining-room that night and face the storm of
congratulations, affectionate jests, and laughing
taunts over her eminence. The last copy
of the Annual had been sold before the gong
whirred out its summons to dinner; and dozens
of dilatory students were already besieging
the chairman for an extra edition. After dinner
Berta was captured for a dance in parlor
J till chapel time. The lilt of the music was
still echoing in her ears, her heart beating in
happy rhythm to its harmony, when at last
she slipped into the back pew and leaned her
head against the wall, her lips relaxing in
happy curves, her hands lying idle in her lap.
</p>
<p>Prexie&#8217;s voice sounded soothingly far away.
Generally he read a chapter first, then gave
out the hymn, and after the singing he always
led in prayer. It hardly seemed worth while
to listen when one&#8217;s own thoughts were so
pleasant. Berta dropped her lashes to hide
the shining light of gladness. Weren&#8217;t they
dear, dear unselfish girls to rejoice with her
and for her! She loved them and they loved
her. The best part of any triumph was the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span>
consciousness that victory would please her
friends and her family. Her mother would
be glad, and her father, the small brothers and
sisters, and even the pretty little sister-in-law.
Eva would not understand entirely, for she
hated to read and cared about nothing but the
babies since Robert had died. Robert would
have sympathized, since he had loved study
almost as much as he had loved Eva. When
he decided to marry, he gave up his science
and went into a bank. He chose a wife and
children instead of congenial ambition. If he
had lived, he would have been glad in Berta&#8217;s
success. Maybe when the baby nieces grew
old enough to understand, they would be
proud of their famous aunt. It was very, very
sweet to feel that people were proud of her.
</p>
<p>Listen! Berta straightened suddenly and
then leaned forward. What was Prexie saying?
Why, he hadn&#8217;t even opened the Bible
yet. &#8220;&mdash;and so, as the essays submitted in
competition were all remarkably good, the
judges would have experienced great difficulty
in reaching a decision if it had not been for
one exceptional even among the dozen most
excellent papers. The prize for the best
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span>
Shakespearean essay has been unanimously
awarded to Miss Roberta Abbott.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A low murmur swept over the bright-hued
congregation. Several faces in the pew before
her turned to smile at Berta. She smiled back
half involuntarily and gripped her fingers together,
conscious only of a smothering sensation
and a wonder that her chest kept heaving
faster and faster. It frightened her to have
things happen like this one after another.
She had won the Shakespearean prize. How
much was it? Thirty dollars? Fifty? It
didn&#8217;t matter. She could take baby Berta to
the seashore with her. She had won. The
girls would get tired of congratulating her.
</p>
<p>Hark! Prexie had gone on speaking.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Accordingly,&#8221; he was saying as Berta
braced herself once more to attention, &#8220;I am
sure you will agree with me that the faculty
acted justly and wisely this afternoon in electing
Miss Roberta Abbott to hold the European
Fellowship this coming year.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The murmur this time swelled to a soft
tumult of fluttering and whispering, which
broke here and there into a muffled clapping,
for everybody liked Berta. But when more
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
faces turned in joyous nodding toward the
back pew they found no answering smile.
Berta in panic had slipped down the aisle and
vanished through the swinging doors into the
dusky corridor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Miss Abbott!&#8221; The messenger girl
overtook her at the foot of the broad staircase.
&#8220;Here is a special delivery letter for you. It
was brought from town five minutes ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Berta glanced at the address. Yes, it was
from her sister-in-law as she had expected.
Eva was always falling into foolish little flurries
and rushing to consult friends and relatives
by mail or wire or word of mouth. Possibly
this important communication was a request
for advice about the babies&#8217; pique coats.
It could wait for a reading till Berta had found
a safe refuge from the girls who would certainly
surround her as soon as chapel was
over. They would follow Robbie and Bea.
</p>
<p>Where could she go to escape the enthusiasm?
Her room would be the first point of
attack, and Bea&#8217;s the second. Ah, now she
recalled Miss Thorne&#8217;s speech about calling for
the commencement essay at this hour. She
might as well go there now and wait till her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span>
critic should return from services, if indeed
she had attended them to-night.
</p>
<p>At the door Berta knocked and bent her
head to listen, then knocked again. Still no
answer. She waited another minute, her
eyes absently hovering over the plants that
banked the wide window there at the end of
the transverse corridor. The evening breeze
sweet from loitering in clover fields drifted in
through the open casement. Miss Thorne was
very fond of flowers. That was a queer trait
in a person who seemed to care so little for
persons. There always seemed something
frozen about this gray-haired, immobile-faced
woman with her stern manner and steely
eyes. Sometimes Berta thought of her as like
a dying fire that smoldered under smothering
ashes.
</p>
<p>Berta turned the knob gently and entered.
A faint rosy glow from the lowered drop-light
shone on the piles of papers and scattered
books on the library table. The curtains rippled
in the sudden draught caused by the
opening of the door, and a whiff of fragrance
from a jar of apple-blossoms on the bookcase
floated past the visitor. Berta glanced around
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span>
with a little shrug that was half a shiver. A
room frequently partakes of the nature of its
occupant; and the atmosphere of this one always
made her heart sink with a quiver of
loneliness over the strange chill of lifelessness
there in spite of the rosy drop-light, the fluttering
curtains, and the drifting breath of
flowers. It was a large room with many easy
chairs in it&mdash;and they were all empty. Even
when Miss Thorne was there it seemed lonesome,
perhaps because she was such a slender
little woman and so icily quiet.
</p>
<p>Berta chose one of the empty chairs and
read the letter. Then she let the sheets fall
loose in her lap and sat there without moving
while the minutes went creeping by and the
transparent curtains rippled now and then in
the evening breeze. Through the window
she could see a great star hanging above the
peak of a shadowy evergreen that stirred
softly to and fro against the fading sky.
Once the twilight call of a distant robin
sounded its long-drawn plaintive music, and
Berta felt her lip tremble. She raised her
hand half unconsciously to soothe the ache in
her throat.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span></p>
<p>Miss Thorne glided in. &#8220;Good evening,
Miss Abbott. May I add my congratulations,
or am I right in concluding that
you have taken refuge here from the persecutions
of your friends? It is a great
pleasure to me to know that you will have
the opportunity to keep on with your studying
this next year. You must allow me to
say so much at least. And now, with regard
to the essay&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Berta watched the slight figure move noiselessly
about in the act of making tea.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wished to call your attention particularly,
Miss Abbott, to the qualities which
strike me as most promising. A vast amount
of futile effort is wasted every year by workers
who have not yet recognized their special
talents. There is continual friction between
the round peg and the square hole, and vice
versa. Now in your case, when you are ready
to plan your course of study for your graduate
work abroad&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The tone was so sharp that Miss Thorne
lifted her head quickly and shot a keen glance
at the girl before her. The attractive face
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span>
had grown strained and the eyes were burning
restlessly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, Berta?&#8221; No student had ever
heard her voice so soft before. &#8220;You are in
trouble.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Berta looked at her for a moment without
replying. Then she picked up her letter,
folded it carefully in its original creases, and
fitted it into the envelope. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said
at last, &#8220;I am in trouble. My sister-in-law
has lost her income from a foolish investment,
entirely her own fault, and she is utterly
helpless. My parents have no money to spare.
There is nobody else but me to support her
and the three babies. She writes that a position
in the high school will be vacant next
year and I ought to apply at once.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Thorne sat silent. &#8220;And there is no
other way?&#8221; she asked after what seemed a
long, long time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;None,&#8221; answered Berta.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will give up the fellowship, your
hopes of doing exceptional work? You will
sacrifice all your ambition and take up the
drudgery of teaching in an uncongenial
sphere for the rest of your life?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I can&#8217;t let the babies go to an orphan
asylum, can I?&#8221; demanded the girl
brusquely to conceal the pain, &#8220;there is no
one else, I tell you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The woman rose and put both arms around
the girl. &#8220;Berta, dear,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you are
right. Once I hesitated at the point where
you are now. I had to choose between the
demands of home and the invitation of ambition.
I let the home-ties snap, and&mdash;here
is my empty room. Now there is nobody
that cares.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Berta glanced around again with a little
shiver. &#8220;There isn&#8217;t any question about it
for me,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to take care of
the babies. And&#8221;&mdash;she straightened her
shoulders suddenly as if throwing off a weight,
&#8220;it won&#8217;t be so hard when I get used to the
idea, because, you see, I&mdash;love them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Faithful Robbie Belle had found out her
refuge somehow and was waiting in the corridor.
With that comforting arm across her
shoulders, Berta poured out the story of her
sudden disappointment.
</p>
<p>At first Robbie was silent. Then she spoke
gently: &#8220;But, Berta, you have had the four
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
years at college, you know, and four years are
a good deal. There are thousands and thousands
of girls who never have even that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; answered Berta, her voice
smothered against the convenient shoulder.
&#8220;And that thought helps&mdash;at least, I think
it will help to-morrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Robbie&#8217;s strong, warm hand sought and
clasped Berta&#8217;s nervous fingers. &#8220;All right,&#8221;
she acquiesced cheerily. &#8220;Now who do you
suppose wrote that epilogue in last year&#8217;s Annual?
